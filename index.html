Tracing the historical career of secular legal concepts in the colonial and postcolonial Middle East, she explores how contradictions at the very heart of political secularism have aggravated and amplified existing forms of Islamic hierarchy, bringing minority relations in Egypt to a new historical impasse. Through a close examination of Egyptian court cases and constitutional debates about minority rights, conflicts around family law, and controversies over freedom of expression, Mahmood invites us to reflect on the entwined histories of secularism in the Middle East and Europe.</p><p>A provocative work of scholarship, <i>Religious Difference in a Secular Age</i> challenges us to rethink the promise and limits of the secular ideal of religious equality.</p></p><p><p>"Saba Mahmood is a premier scholar of the constitutive powers of secular governance. This extraordinary work is at once a fascinating ethnography of two religious minorities in Egypt and a compelling formulation of how secularism generates strife it claims only to modulate."<b>--Wendy Brown, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"Mahmood delivers an expectedly insightful scholarly performance about the ways secularism, purported to be a solution to interreligious conflict, has in fact not only contributed to that conflict but also exacerbated it by producing new forms of religious polarization. This book is both an indispensable and intellectually delightful read."<b>--Wael B. Hallaq, author of <i>The Impossible State: Islam, Politics, and Modernity's Moral Predicament</i></b></p><p>"In this stunning book, Mahmood calls into question a good deal of the received wisdom about secularism and the divisions between East and West. <i>Religious Difference in a Secular Age</i> is original, pathbreaking, and important."<b>--Joan Wallach Scott, author of <i>The Politics of the Veil</i></b></p><p>"Written by one of the most prominent anthropologists of her generation, <i>Religious Difference in a Secular Age</i> is a significant contribution to political theory and the study of religion in the contemporary world."<b>--Webb Keane, author of <i>Christian Moderns: Freedom and Fetish in the Mission Encounter</i></b></p><b>Saba Mahmood</b> is professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. She is the author of <i>Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and the Feminist Subject</i> (Princeton) and the coauthor of <i>Is Critique Secular? Blasphemy, Injury, and Free Speech</i>.</p><h2>Practical Chinese Reader: Elementary Course, Book 1</h2><p>This textbook prepared by the Beijing Languages Institute and intended for foreign learners in a course of modern Chinese at universities or secondary schools. The beginning level consists of two volumes with 50 lessons and a vocabulary of 1,000 basic words. <br><br>The situations provided in this textbook center around two foreign students who study Chinese first in their own country (Book 1) and then in China (Book 2). Priority is given to everyday expressions concerning clothing, food, housing, communication, entertainment, social intercourse, etc. And the learners may also get some useful background information regarding China's culture, history, local customs and present-day conditions. <br><br>Basic Chinese phonetics and grammar are dealt with a way that best solves the specific difficulties of foreign learners. Each lesson is supplemented with a wide and varied selection of exercises.</p><p></p><h2>Techniques of Asymptotic Analysis (Applied Mathematical Sciences)</h2><p>These notes originate from a one semester course which forms part of the &#34;Math Methods&#34; cycle at Brown. In the hope that these notes might prove useful for reference purposes several additional sections have been included and also a table of contents and index. Although asymptotic analysis is now enjoying a period of great vitality, these notes do not reflect a research oriented course. The course is aimed toward people in applied mathematics, physics, engineering, etc., who have a need for asymptotic analysis in their work. The choice of subjects has been largely dictated by the likelihood of application. Also abstraction and generality have not been pursued. Technique and computation are given equal prominence with theory. Both rigorous and formal theory is presented --very often in tandem. In practice, the means for a rigorous analysis are not always available. For this reason a goal has been the cultivation of mature formal reasoning. Therefore, during the course of lectures formal presentations gradually eclipse rigorous presentations. When this occurs, rigorous proofs are given as exercises or in the case of lengthy proofs, reference is made to the Reading List at the end.</p><p></p><h2>Chinese Religion: An Introduction (A volume in the Wadsworth Religious Life in History Series)</h2><p>This accessible introduction to the study of Chinese religion presents religious expression as a manifestation of Chinese culture. Like other books in Wadsworth&#39;s Religious Life in History Series, this text explores religion as a means to &#39;&#39;ultimate transformation.&#39;&#39;</p><p></p><h2>Electrical Engineering: Principles and Applications, 4th Edition</h2><p><b></b> The author's guiding philosophy in writing this book has three elements: to present basic concepts to readers in a general setting, to show how the principles of electrical engineering apply to specific problems in their own fields, and to remove frustration from the learning process. Emphasizing the basic concepts of the field, this book covers circuit analysis, digital systems, electronics, and electromechanics. <b></b> This book develops theoretical and experimental skills and experiences in the following areas: basic circuit analysis and measurement, first- and second-order transients, steady-state ac circuits, resonance and frequency response, digital logic circuits, microcontrollers (68HC11), computer-based instrumentation, diode circuits, electronic amplifiers, field-effect and bipolar junction transistors, operational amplifiers, ac and dc machines, and more. <b></b> For engineers or any other professionals who need a solid foundation in the basics of circuits, digital systems, analog electronics, and electromechanics.</p><p>Designed specifically for non-majors, this user-friendly text provides a solid foundation in the basics of circuits, electronics (analog and digital), and electromechanics and shows students how the principles apply to interesting, specific, real problems in their own fields.Tomorrow's Engineers<br> <br> <p>Finding and developing practical ways to provide the energy needed for modern technical societies on a sustainable basis without disrupting the environment is the most important problem confronting the coming generation of engineers and scientists. Among the proposed energy sources, two of which (solar and wind) are used by the dandelion to grow and disperse its seeds are:</p> Wind energy <li>Earth-based solar thermal concentrators and photovoltaic solar cells</li> <li>Hydroelectric energy</li> <li>Biomass energy</li> <li>Geothermal energy</li> <li>Gulf stream, wave, and tidal energy</li> <li>Clean coal, in which the C02 is captured and stored ot recycled in a biomass energy plant</li> <li>Systems of nuclear fission reactors combined with hybrid fission/fusion reactors that burn the waste products of the fission reactors</li> <li>Nuclear fusion</li> <li>Hydrogen from water using sunlight aided by a catalyst</li> <p>Enhanced power grids may need to be built to distribute energy from some of these proposed solutions. Conservation must also play a part, possibly including:</p> <ul> <li>More efficient power grids</li> <li>Hybrid or electric vehicles</li> <li>Better mass transportation for people</li> <li>Hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles</li> <li>Efficient lighting</li> <li>More/better rail systems in place of trucks and highways</li> <li>Better building design</li> <li>Better intelligence in energy consumption</li> </ul> <p>Regardless of which solutions ultimately emerge, it is certain that all of the topics discussed in this book will play important roles. For example, see the Practical Application concerning energy-storage systems for electric vehicles starting on page 100.</p></p><h2>The Bridge Betrayed: Religion and Genocide in Bosnia (Volume 11) (Comparative Studies in Religion and Society)</h2><p>The recent atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina have stunned people throughout the world. With Holocaust memories still painfully vivid, a question haunts us: how is this savagery possible? Michael A. Sells answers by demonstrating that the Bosnian conflict is not simply a civil war or a feud of age-old adversaries. It is, he says, a systematic campaign of genocide and a Christian holy war spurred by religious mythologies.<br><br>This passionate yet reasoned book examines how religious stereotyping&#x2015;in popular and official discourse&#x2015;has fueled Serbian and Croatian ethnic hatreds. Sells, who is himself Serbian American, traces the cultural logic of genocide to the manipulation by Serb nationalists of the symbolism of Christ's death, in which Muslims are "Christ-killers" and Judases who must be mercilessly destroyed. He shows how "Christoslavic" religious nationalism became a central part of Croat and Serbian politics, pointing out that intellectuals and clergy were key instruments in assimilating extreme religious and political ideas.<br><br>Sells also elucidates the ways that Western policy makers have rewarded the perpetrators of the genocide and punished the victims. He concludes with a discussion of how the multireligious nature of Bosnian society has been a bridge between Christendom and Islam, symbolized by the now-destroyed bridge at Mostar. Drawing on historical documents, unpublished United Nations reports, articles from Serbian and Bosnian media, personal contacts in the region, and Internet postings, Sells reveals the central role played by religious mythology in the Bosnian tragedy. In addition, he makes clear how much is at stake for the entire world in the struggle to preserve Bosnia's existence as a multireligious society.</p><p>"Sells brings a deep historical perspective to bear on recent events, and he powerfully indicts not only those Balkan leaders who manipulate popular fears and fanaticism to further their expansionist aims, but also those Western politicians and diplomats who helped obscure the truth about the campaign by Serb and Croat religious nationalists to destroy the uniquely rich culture of Bosnia."&#x2015;William Finnegan, staff reporter for <i>The New Yorker</i> and author of <i>A Complicated War</i><b>Michael A. Sells</b> is Professor and Chairperson of the Department of Religion at Haverford College. He is the author of several books on religion, including <i>Mystical Languages of Unsaying</i> (1994).</p><h2>How to be Good at Maths</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Carol Vorderman, one of Britain&#39;s best known and loved TV personalities, feels passionately about the value of education.

It is an intimate epic, an excavation of the self, and a comedy of manners by turns and all at once. Proust is the twentieth century&#39;s Dante, presenting us with a unique, unsettling picture of ourselves as jealous lovers and unmitigated snobs, frittering our lives away, with only the hope of art as a possible salvation. He offers us a form of redemption for a sober and secular age. Scott Moncrieff&#39;s delightful translation was for many years the only access to Proust in English. A labour of love that took him nearly as many years as Proust spent writing the original. Moncrieff&#39;s translation strives to capture the extraordinary blend of muscular analysis with poetic reverie that typifies Proust&#39;s style. It remains a justly famous classic of translation.</p><p>Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff was born in Scotland in 1889 and served on the Western Front in the First World War, where he was seriously injured at the Battle of Arras. In 1922, he started work on his famous translation of Proust&#39;s novel, taking his English title from Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnet 30. He was still translating the novel at the time of his death in Rome in 1930.Scott Moncrieff&#39;s [volumes] belong to that special category of translations which are themselves literary masterpieces ... his book is one of those translations, such as the Authorized Version of the Bible itself, which can never be displaced -- A. N. Wilson For the reader wishing to tackle Proust your guide must be C K Scott Moncrieff ... There are some who believe his headily perfumed translation of A la recherche du temps perdu conjures Belle Epoque France more vividly even than the original Telegraph I was more interested and fascinated by your rendering than by Proust&#39;s creation --Joseph Conrad to Scott Moncrieff</p><h2>The Signature of Jesus</h2><p>Updated and expanded with a new first chapter, The Signature of Jesus challenges the gospel of &#34;cheap grace&#34; and calls the church to radical discipleship. With passion and boldness, author Brennan Manning invites readers to risk living life as Jesus lived: committed to simplicity, purity of heart, and obedience to the gospel.</p><p>Brennan Manning is often on the road, speaking of God&#39;s unconditional love at church retreats and conferences. A popular author, his other books include The Signature of Jesus and Abba&#39;s Child. Brennan and his wife, Roslyn, make their home in New Orleans.<i><b>Chapter One<br></b>From Haran to Canaan<br><br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Abram leaves Haran&#x2014;&#x201c;your country, your people and your father&#x2019;s house&#x201d;&#x2014;he embarks on a journey<br>he has never made to a land he never has seen. He sets out, not because he can predict the role he is to play in the history of salvation, but simply because of his personal experience, the spiritual experience of God speaking to him.<br>There is no program he can detail; no insight into history with which he can support his decision; no model through<br>which he can obtain a psychological identity. Spiritual experience has become a summons: It is God who directs.<br>And the future is God&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God will, in time, show him the land.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God will have him father a nation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only God will make his life into a blessing for all the wretched and blundering children of this earth. What is decisive at this moment for Abram is not a vision of the next twenty years, but a quality of religious experience, a present influence of God. This touches the core of faith: to believe in a personal God who calls me and leads me. Abram obeys that call. For the time being, the call is enough. Had he demanded to know more of the details<br>and practicalities of the game plan, he would have demonstrated the antithesis of faith, for faith is never based on<br>human assurances.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the New Testament, Zechariah, who wanted to be sure, insisted upon some divine guarantee before yielding<br>to God&#x2019;s word (see Luke 1:18). That is not faith.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The journey of the man who would become known as Abraham is a paradigm of all authentic faith. His is a movement into obscurity, into the undefined, into ambiguity, and not into some predetermined, clearly delineated plan for the future. Each future determination, each next step discloses itself only out of a discernment of the influence of God in the present moment. &#x201c;By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going&#x201d; (Hebrews 11:8, italics mine). The reality of life for Christian men and women requires that they leave what is nailed down, obvious, and secure, and walk into the desert without rational explanations to justify their decisions or guarantee their future. Why? Solely and simply because God signals this movement and offers it his promise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is instructive to remember that prior to his encounter with the one true God, Abraham, like everyone else in his tribe and country of Haran, had held many religious beliefs. (Even an atheist has them, for not to believe in God is, in itself, a religious belief.1 ) What happened to Abraham was that he was summoned by God from these religious beliefs to faith&#x2014;an enormous step.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For contemporary Christians, there is an essential difference between belief and faith. Our religious beliefs are the<br>visible expression of our faith, our personal commitment to the person of Jesus. However, if the Christian beliefs inherited from our family and passed on to us by our church tradition are not grounded in a shattering, life-changing<br>experience of Jesus as the Christ, then the chasm between our creedal statements and our faith-experience widens and our witness is worthless. The gospel will persuade no one unless it has so convicted us that we are transformed by it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two thousand years of church history, why is our world&#x2019;s population only one-third Christian? Why are the<br>personalities of many pious Christians so opaque? Why did Friedrich Nietzsche reproach Christians for &#x201c;not looking<br>like they are saved&#x201d;? Why do we so seldom hear in our day what the old lawyer said of John Vianney, &#x201c;An&nbsp; extraordinary thing happened to me today: I saw Christ in a man&#x201d;? Why don&#x2019;t our contagious joy, enthusiasm, and gratitude infect others with a longing for Christ? Why are the fire and spirit of Peter and Paul so conspicuously absent from our pallid existence?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because so few of us have undertaken the journey of faith across the chasm between knowledge and<br>experience. We prefer to read the map rather than visit the place. The specter of our actual unbelief persuades us that it is not the experience that is real but, rather, our explanation of the experience. Our beliefs&#x2014;which William Blake called &#x201c;the mind-forged manacle&#x201d;&#x2014;distance us from the grip of personal experience.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel Taylor writes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secular world of ideas plays the doubting game<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; almost exclusively and is usually scornful of anyone<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who doesn&#x2019;t. Ironically, however, the church also<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plays this game to a great extent. The mystery of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gospel, the paradox of the incarnation, and the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wondrous enigma of grace are freeze-dried into a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highly rationalized and/or authoritarian system of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theologies, codes, rules, prescriptions, orders of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; service, and forms of church government.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything is written down, everything is organized,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that all can be certain and those in error<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detected.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The movement from Haran to Canaan is the journey across the chasm. We have to pass definitively beyond<br>beliefs to faith. Yes, we are called to believe in Jesus. But our belief summons us to something greater, to faith in him. Faith that will force us to pursue the mind of Christ, to embrace a lifestyle of prayer, unselfishness, goodness, and involvement in building his kingdom, not our own.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When God called Abraham to abandon the security of the world familiar to him, he also asked Abraham to for-<br>sake his polytheistic religious beliefs. All his previous concepts of God faded away. The same process is necessary for<br>us. When we encounter the God revealed by and in Jesus Christ, we must revise all our previous thinking about God.<br>Jesus, as the revealer of the Godhead, defines God as love. In light of this revelation, we have to abandon the cankerous, worm-eaten structure of legalism, moralism, and perfectionism that corrupts the Good News into an ethical<br>code rather than a love affair. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus lanced the infection of religious belief that had lost its soul and did not even know it. The Pharisees had distorted the image of God into some remote bookkeeper who is constantly snooping around after sinners (and one day will nail us if our accounts are not in order). The Pharisees were so busy refining and finessing the formulas of religion, so assiduous in studying what they believed, that they forgot the reality their beliefs signified. They had believed for so long but their faith had dulled. They had awaited the Messiah for so long, their expectancy was blunted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, despite Jesus&#x2019; condemnation of pharisaic religion, the spirit of legalism, &#x201c;like the vilest seed of the overgrown Garden, has flourished on the trellis of the centuries.&#x201d;3 Many Christians remain afraid, for they still<br>cling to an idea of God very different from that preached by Jesus. They remain in Haran with their old belief system<br>intact. They believe they can save themselves by holding still and not breathing or by embarking on fasts, vigils, or<br>heroic enterprises, hoping to coax approbation from God.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again and again Jesus stated that fear is the enemy of life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be afraid; just believe&#x201d; (Luke 8:50).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been<br>pleased to give you the kingdom&#x201d; (Luke 12:32).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Take courage! It is I. Don&#x2019;t be afraid&#x201d; (Matthew 14:27).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear breeds a deadening caution, a holding back, a stagnant waiting until people no longer can recall what they are waiting for or saving themselves for. When we fear failure more than we love life; when we are dominated by<br>thoughts of what we might have been rather than by thoughts of what we might become; when we are haunted<br>by the disparity between our ideal self and our real self; when we are tormented by guilt, shame, remorse, and selfcondemnation, we deny our faith in the God of love. God calls us to break camp, abandon the comfort and security of the status quo, and embark in perilous freedom on the journey to a new Canaan. But when we procrastinate out<br>of fear, this represents not only a decision to remain in Haran, but also a lack of trust.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My own faltering faith caused me to procrastinate regarding God&#x2019;s call to marry Roslyn. I postponed the<br>decision for three years (which was a decision itself ) hoping that God would grow weary of waiting and the inner<br>voice of Truth would get laryngitis. Before leaving the familiar landscape of the Franciscan life, I wanted God to<br>sketch out definite lines so that I might know explicitly where I was going. Of course, authentic faith eludes such<br>certainty. It means we cannot cling to anything. We always must leave something behind and not look back (see Luke<br>9:62). If we refuse to keep moving and insist on signs and tangible proofs, we diminish our faith, and that means<br>unbelief. Ironically, throughout the entire process my religious beliefs remained steadfast and unwavering.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The God of Abraham, who is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, is not a threat. The certainty that he wants us<br>to live, to grow, to unfold, and to experience fullness of life is the basic premise of authentic faith. Yet my reluctance to pray the prayer of abandonment of Charles de Foucauld&#x2014;&#x201c;Father, do with me whatever you want&#x201d;&#x2014;reveals that I am still in the iron grip of skepticism and fear: Letting God have at me may jeopardize my health, my reputation, and my security. He might strip me of my red suspenders and Rolex and send me off to Tanzania as a missionary. If he would just let me stay in the temple of my familiar, I would entrust myself to him wholeheartedly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biblical faith is an attitude acquired gradually through many crises and trials. Through the agonizing test with his<br>son Isaac (see Genesis 22:1&#x2013;19), Abraham learns that God wants us to live and not to die, to grow and not to wither.<br>He knows that the God who called him to hope against hope is reliable. &#x201c;Perhaps this is the essence of faith: to be<br>convinced of the reliability of God.&#x201d;</p><h2>Beyond the Adirondacks: The Story of St. Regis Paper Company (Contributions in Economics and Economic History)</h2><p>First edition.

Each was a victim of domestic violence, escaped from her abuser, reclaimed her dignity, reconstructed her life, and rediscovered peace. Domestic violence doesn&#x2019;t just happen "out there" somewhere. It happens in our town, in our neighborhood, on our street. It happens to women we see at work, the supermarket, the movie theater, the ballet and the PTA board meeting. Every woman who has left an abusive man&#x2014;every woman who has yet to leave&#x2014;will find encouragement and hope in the voices of these women who broke free.</p><p>It is with pride that Volcano Press is publishing Elaine Weiss. Her books demonstrate the great advances in the struggle against family violence that have taken place since we first published BATTERED WIVES in the early 1970s. <p>In those early days, a handful of feminists, scattered across the United States, were creating shelters for battered women--without funding, without community understanding, against great odds. It was and still is a historic movement. </p><p>Today, we have the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which established an agency of the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, there are many state domestic violence coalitions and a myriad of local and national programs to support battered women. </p><p>And, as author Elaine Weiss says, "Most abused women are not passive victims. They show enormous strength, both while they are within the relationship, and as they work to extricate themselves. One proof of this strength is the huge number who ultimately manage to break free and go on with their lives. They do not wait to be rescued. They rescue themselves. They are resourceful. They fight back. They take care of themselves, and often of their children." </p><p>We thank Elaine for giving voices to these women. </p><p>Ruth Gottstein, Publisher <br>Adam Gottstein, Associate Publisher <br>Volcano Press</p>"Writing this book," I wrote in the summer of 1999, as I put the finishing touches on the first printing of Surviving Domestic Violence, "has taught me that stories can be gifts." Each woman I interviewed gave me the gift of her story. I was touched and honored that they gave so freely of themselves. <p>Today, four years later, as I write the prologue to the newest printing, I still believe that stories are gifts. But since the book has been published, I have continued to receive gifts. These days, my gifts are the words of my readers: men and women who have written to me, sharing their thoughts and feelings about the book. </p><p>I made it easy for them do so by including my e-mail address in the book. I admit that I agonized over this decision. Would anyone bother to write? What would they say? Naturally, I hoped my readers would thank me for my words. I hoped they would tell me that the book had helped them untangle the messy threads of abuse in their own lives or in the lives of someone they cared about. At the same time, I feared (my fears reinforced by the little voice that whispers in a corner of my mind at two o&#x2019;clock in the morning) that the book would stagnate on bookstore shelves as the occasional browser flipped idly through a few pages and returned it to the shelf. </p><p>May this book help other women "break free".</p></p><h2>Advanced Organic Chemistry: Structure and Mechanisms (Advanced Organic Chemistry / Part A: Structure and Mechanisms)</h2><p>Since its original appearance in 1977, Advanced Organic Chemistry has found wide use as a text providing broad coverage of the structure, reactivity and synthesis of organic compounds.

And here Albert Zuckerman, agent and editorial advisor to many successful authors in every genre, discloses the somewhat hidden nuts and bolts of what makes this type of book tick, and shows how you, too, could write a novel that might sell in the millions.</p><p>Albert Zuckerman has been an agent for more than 20 years. He represents Ken Follett and has helped several other writers reach the best-seller list. He lives in New York City.Zuckerman, a veteran literary agent representing such best-selling authors as Ken Follett and Eileen Goudge, here explains how authors can get their novels onto the best-sellers list. This book is not intended for beginning writers but will help those who have mastered the craft of novel writing and now wish to write a book with blockbuster potential. Of course, there are no guarantees here: the reading public is fickle, and, ultimately, readers are the ones who make best sellers. That said, Zuckerman knows what works most of the time. He spends the two largest sections of the book on outlining and revision. Authors need to know where they are going, and a detailed outline will help them map a plan to bring together all the characters and plot lines. Best-selling novels by Follett, Goudge, and others are used as examples. This will be useful in libraries that serve writers. Recommended.<br><i>- Lisa J. Co chenet, Plainfield P.L.

Along the way, he begins to understand the Aztec belief system and the art of healing, as well as the dark past of San Mart�n infamous through Mexico for its <i>brujos,</i> or witches, and a mysterious War of Witches&#x201d; fifty years earlier that may never have ended.Capturing time and place as surely as a jeweler sets a stone, Knab chronicles his spiritual immersion into the contemporary Aztec culture and, ultimately, his remarkable transformation into an authentic <i>curandero.</i> Part murder mystery, part soaring supernatural dream tales all informed by serious anthropological research <i>A War of Witches</i> will keep you breathless and on the edge of your seat from the very first page to the explosive revelations in the final chapter.</p><p><b>Timothy J. Knab</b> has spent decades researching and working with contemporary Aztecs in Mexico. He is a <i>curandero;</i> a former anthropology professor at the National University of Mexico; a visiting lecturer at Wellesley College and Tufts University; a professional chef and an acknowledged expert on Mexican and French cuisines; and the editor of <i>A Scattering of Jades: Stories, Poems, and Prayers of the Aztecs.</i>In this fantastical combination of personal revelation and local history, Knab unravels secrets of an ancient vendetta in a Mexican village. An anthropologist by trade, Knab develops a practicing belief in the supernatural Aztec practices holding sway in San Martin, up in the mountainous fastnesses east of Mexico City. In the course of his initiation into a spiritual world of dreams, spells, and death, he increasingly earns the trust of his teachers, old lady Rubia and old man Inocente. He becomes a healer, and in treating a morose girl, Knab connects her relatives with a man in his dreams named "Cruz." The relatives show Knab a family picture that proves Cruz was real and not a REM hallucination. That fact melts the reticence of the two elderly spiritualists to discuss his death back in the 1930s, which occurred against the background of a land-ownership dispute. The fight was largely carried on by witches armed with curses, and it peaked with a scarcely believable tale of a crucifixion, leaving a legacy of silence that only a believing acolyte could pierce. In our world, modernity and traditionalism seem congenital enemies, but this tale--part murder mystery, part dream interpretation, part multicultural encounter--honestly reveals how they actually coexist in this remote place. Fascinating for readers engaged by exotic paganism--or by a plain, good story well told. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The Heart of Mathematics: An invitation to effective thinking</h2><p>The power and attractiveness of the subject of mathematics is often hidden from students who are in introductory courses.

R. Lindner Chair of Evangelical Theology, Northern Seminary; author, The End of Evangelicalism? <br> <br><p>The Permanent Revolution</p> <p>The Permanent Revolution is an original work of theological re-imagination and re-construction that draws from biblical studies, theology, organizational theory, leadership studies, and key social sciences. The book elaborates on the apostolic role rooted in the five-fold ministry from Ephesians 4 (apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers), and its significance for the missional movement.</p> <p>Throughout the book, the authors propose a revolutionary missional ecclesiology that is shaped by the New Testament account of apostolic imagination, ministry, and strategy. The aim is to reclaim the ministry by which the church is to remain centered on its calling to be the instrument of God's mission, and that everything it is and does ought to relate to and demonstrate that calling. To (re)capture the practice of apostolicity, the authors explore how the apostolic ministry facilitates ongoing renewal in the life of the church and focus on leadership in relation to missional innovation and entrepreneurship. They examine the nature of organization as reframed through the lens of apostolic ministry and explore how apostolic leadership provides new and missionally creative ways forward.</p> <p>The Permanent Revolution is filled with challenging concepts and is replete with innovative ideas. Rather than providing a prescriptive model for leadership, it offers spiritual prods and suggestive thought experiments that are designed to stimulate imagination as well as action. If faithful leaders are to take up the work of ministry as laid out in the New Testament, this book offers a significant pathway to help equip them to better fulfill their mission.</p></p><h2>Starck&#39;s Prayer Book</h2><p>If man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God, then Johann Starck has provided a bread basket for the Church with his Prayer-Book. This book of daily prayers, hymns, poetry, and devotions presents in every syllable the Bread that has come down from heaven. Written as daily nourishment in the Word of God, this book also lends itself to meditation and prayer during many of lifes peculiar situations. Professor Dau describes Starck well when he writes, Starck loved nothing sensational, nothing that was for mere display in matters of religion. Christian life, to him, was real and earnest, to be conducted in a sober mind. He was always bent on its practical applications to every pursuit and action, and on enlisting really the whole of a person in the service of the Master. When Christians nourish their souls daily with meditation upon the Word of God and the Sacraments, faith is strengthened. The Bread of Life fills hearts and minds, and Christ finds expression in the world through Christian life and speech. A contemporary pastor said it best when he said Starck gives Christians a daily helping of meditation in Gods Word, and leads them to satisfaction in their vocational tasks.</p><p></p><h2>Color and Fire: Defining Moments in Studio Ceramics, 1950-2000</h2><p>Drawn from the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, <i>Color &amp; Fire: Defining Moments in Studio Ceramics, 1950-2000</i> accompanies a major touring exhibition on the history of ceramic art in the second half of the twentieth century. Illustrated with more than 250 color photographs, <i>Color &amp; Fire</i> explores the roles of key artists and the major stylistic movements they developed during the decades of pioneering innovation.<br><br>Based on the premise that the history of studio ceramics can be regarded as a series of breakthroughs or milestones, <i>Color &amp; Fire</i> highlights the moments when talented artists came together to produce work in clay that challenged traditions and promoted aesthetic freedom. In the early years of the twentieth century, pottery was primarily mass-produced in factories, where specialists in wheel throwing, glazing, and kiln firing worked under a system of divided labor. In the 1930s and 1940s, ceramists such as the renowned team of Gertrud and Otto Natzler began to perform all of these exacting functions-from mixing clay to firing kilns-in their own studios, creating one-of-a-kind pots, breathtaking in design and construction. Since that time, ceramic art has followed a metaphorical journey from the earth to the air, as concerns with utility, materials, and techniques have given way to abstract conceptual considerations.<br><br>In Los Angeles in the 1950s, Peter Voulkos and his students upset the traditional values of craft pottery and the Bauhaus- inspired "form follows function" doctrine by creating nonfunctional, oversized, off-kilter vessels with cracks and holes, along with massive Abstract Expressionist monuments. In the 1960s in northern California, Robert Arneson and his students shattered taboos against clay as a sculptural medium in the oversized, off-kilter vessels with cracks and holes, along with massive Abstract Expressionist monuments. In the 1960s in northern California, Robert Arneson and his students shattered taboos against clay as a sculptural medium in the hands of potters with their radical, irreverent, and satirical "Funk" pieces. Today, no longer confined to the decorative arts or other craft categories, ceramic artists around the world explore an unlimited range of influences, styles, and ideas, engaging in a graceful and inventive dialogue with centuries of ceramic tradition.<br><br>A celebration as well as a valuable art-historical survey, <i>Color &amp; Fire: Defining Moments in Studio Ceramics, 1950-2000</i> showcases the finest works form the unparalleled collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

He elucidates how special relativity is a reconciliation of the contradictions between the nature of light and the principle of relativity; he expands on Einstein's treatment of the geometry of space-time and the fundamental notion of an "event"; he explains in detail, but without technical language, the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass, a cornerstone of general relativity.</p></p><p><p>What could be better than an introduction to the theory of relativity by Albert Einstein himself? One that combines Einstein's original text, written for the layperson nearly a century ago, with insights from today's leading experts. </p> <p>Einstein shattered common-sense notions of space and time with the publication of his special theory of relativity in 1905. In the general theory of relativity, published in 1916, he extended the special theory to include gravity, supplanting Newton's law of universal gravitation, the zenith of the Scientific Revolution. In Relativity: The Special and General Theory, Einstein took his revolutionary theory directly to the people. In simple terms, he carefully laid out the basic concepts of relativity. But almost ninety years have passed since Einstein penned this classic; many advances have been made in our understanding of relativity and space and time.</p> <p>Robert Geroch, one of the world's preeminent experts on relativity, builds on Einstein's work with commentary that addresses the ideas at the heart of the theory, bringing a modern understanding of relativity to the text. He elucidates how special relativity is a reconciliation of the contradictions between the nature of light and the principle of relativity (a long-standing tenet of physics known since Galileo's time); he expands on Einstein's treatment of the geometry of space-time and the fundamental notion of an "event"; he explains in detail, but without technical language, the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass, a cornerstone of general relativity.</p> <p>Roger Penrose's eloquent introduction frames the creation of both the special and the general theories in the history of science. He argues that even without Einstein, the special theory would have been formulated, as its essential ideas had been put forward before 1905. But the general theory, he shows, is so unique and revolutionary that, without Einstein, we still may not have it today. He also discusses important developments in general relativity since Einstein's death, and the significance of the theory from the vantage point of contemporary science.</p> <p>David C. Cassidy explores the impact of relativity outside of physics. In a century of unprecedented scientific advances, yet one of great turmoil, violence, and disillusionment, relativity became a tool of ideologies. Cassidy shows that while the theory reinforced the idea of scientific progress for some, the counterintuitive nature of the theory alienated many nonscientists, opening a rift between science and the public that continues to grow today.</p> <p>Fully updated 100 years after Einstein published his first papers on relativity, this classic account by the man himself is now ready for twenty-first century readers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"It is remarkable that Einstein should have produced such an account for the lay public so soon after his general theory was completed. This view has now superbly survived the tests of time.... In this new edition we are fortunate in having the advantage of an excellent exposition of Einstein's foundational ideas on relativity from a more modern perspective in Robert Geroch's commentary."</p> <p>&#x2013;From the Introduction by Roger Penrose, author of The Emperor's New Mind and The Road To Reality.</p> <p>"One good way to get a feeling for what relativity theory is all about is to read, in these pages, what the originator of the subject had to say. I have provided comments, attached to various sections of Einstein's book. The key to understanding relativity is to think about it for yourself."</p> <p>&#x2013;From the Commentary by Robert Geroch, Professor of Physics, University of Chicago.</p> <p>"Relativity was a highly technical new theory that gave new meanings to familiar concepts and even to the nature of theory itself. The general public looked upon relativity as indicative of the seemingly incomprehensible modern era, educated non-scientists despaired of ever understanding what Einstein had done, and political ideologues used the new theory to exploit public fears and anxieties&#x2013;all of which opened a rift between science and the broader culture that continues to expand today."</p> <p>&#x2013;From the Historical Essay by David C. Cassidy, author of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the American Century, and Einstein and Our World.</p> <p>"All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual toward freedom."</p> <p>&#x2013;Albert Einstein</p><br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

The cosmos, once understood as a stagnant place, filled with the ordinary, is now a universe that is expanding at an accelerating pace, propelled by dark energy and structured by dark matter. Priyamvada Natarajan, our guide to these ideas, is someone at the forefront of the research&#x2014;an astrophysicist who literally creates maps of invisible matter in the universe. She not only explains for a wide audience the science behind these essential ideas but also provides an understanding of how radical scientific theories gain acceptance.<br><br> The formation and growth of black holes, dark matter halos, the accelerating expansion of the universe, the echo of the big bang, the discovery of exoplanets, and the possibility of other universes&#x2014;these are some of the puzzling cosmological topics of the early twenty-first century. Natarajan discusses why the acceptance of new ideas about the universe and our place in it has never been linear and always contested even within the scientific community. And she affirms that, shifting and incomplete as science always must be, it offers the best path we have toward making sense of our wondrous, mysterious universe.</p><p><b>Priyamvada Natarajan</b> is professor of astronomy and physics at Yale University and holds the Sophie and Tycho Brahe Professorship at the Dark Center, Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, and an honorary professorship at the University of Delhi, India."Extremely well researched. . . . According to Natarajan, the word 'universe' may be on the verge of its most radical redefinition yet."&#x2014;Marcus Chown, <i>Times Higher Education</i><br>"I am studying the big picture as thrillingly projected in <i>Mapping the Heavens</i>, a strikingly lucid account of the expansion, not just of the universe, but of the way we have tried to understand it, from the Babylonians to black holes and dark matter."&#x2014;Richard Holmes, "By the Book," <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"By introducing the major players behind each discovery, Natarajan adds a lively human touch to her discussion, reinforcing the dynamism of a field that 'fans human curiosity and is driven by it as well.'"&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i>(starred review)<br>"Both novel and absorbing. . . . Her phrase 'Mapping the Heavens' is both literal and metaphorical. Natarajan describes the revolutions that have taken place in our ability to explore the structure of our universe. But the point she makes is deeper. By describing developments in cosmology&#x2014;including the discovery of other galaxies, the discovery of the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, black holes, and the mysterious dark energy causing the observed expansion of the universe to be speeding up&#x2014;she succeeds in demonstrating how the progress of fundamental science often challenges the mental &#x2018;maps&#x2019; that scientists conceive to represent their ideas."&#x2014;Lawrence M. Krauss, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br>Won an Honorable Mention in the Cosmology and Astronomy category for the 2017 American Publishers Awards for Professional &amp; Scholarly Excellence <i>(PROSE)</i><br>Priyamvada Naterajan is the winner of the 2018 Gustav Ranis International Book Prize for <i>Mapping the Heavens: The Radical Scientific Ideas that Reveal the Cosmos</i>.<br>"<i>Mapping the Heavens</i> gives a highly readable, insider's view of recent discoveries in astronomy with unusual attention to the instruments used and the human drama of the scientists."&#x2014;Alan Lightman, author of <i>The Accidental Universe</i> and <i>Einstein's Dream</i><br>"This excellent book describes the boisterous debates and hard slog&nbsp;whereby our current understanding of the cosmos has emerged. It's&nbsp;especially welcome as a faithful portrayal of how science is actually done."&#x2014;Martin Rees, author of <i>Just Six Numbers</i><br>"Priyamvada Natarajan&#x2019;s love affair with the heavens began in childhood, continues with her notable work in astrophysics, and is now enhanced with this insightful overview of the hottest topics in astronomy today&#x2014;including black holes, dark matter, dark energy, and exoplanets. Moreover, she traces how these ideas struggled to get accepted, providing the reader with an excellent peek at how science gets done."&#x2014;Marcia Bartusiak, author of <i>Black Hole</i> and <i>The Day We Found the Universe</i><br>"Part history, part science, all illuminating. If you want to understand the greatest ideas that shaped our current cosmic cartography, read this book."&#x2014;Adam G. Riess, Nobel Laureate in Physics, 2011<br>"Here is an authoritative guide to the major cosmological breakthroughs of the past century.&nbsp;Natarajan writes as an accomplished guide to contemporary astronomy including dark matter and dark energy."&#x2014;Owen Gingerich, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics<br>&#x201c;Priyamvada Natarajan is a professor of physics and astronomy at Yale, who has spent her life investigating dark matter, dark energy and black holes. In <i>Mapping the Heavens</i>, she stands back and presents a broad picture of our slow advance in measuring and then interpreting the complexity of the universe... &nbsp;Considering humanity in relation to the universe, Natarajan explains that we have very little idea of where we are going. She asks us to adapt Galileo&#x2019;s perspective &#x2013; he was the first to prove that the Moon was mountainous, and to measure the mountain heights, but was certainly incapable of predicting that a mere 360 years later we would walk on its surface or return home with suitcases of lunar material.&#x201d;&#x2014;David W.

Horatio said, startled by his friend's words. "Murdered his own brother? I don't believe it."</i><br><i> "You didn't believe in ghosts either," Hamlet said. "But there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. I tell you, something is rotten in the state of Denmark."</i><br><br>A dramatic and modern retelling of the classic drama with superb art throughout. Written by an outstanding scholar, this made-just-for-them <i>Hamlet </i>will foster in children a lifetime love of the Bard. The language is simple yet eloquent, and draws the children into the story with superb dialogue, vivid description, and careful attention to the flow of events. The skillful blending of Shakespeare's own lines with modern language and illuminating information enhances youngsters' involvement and comprehension. There's background on Shakespeare and the play; answers to FAQs, such as "Why isn't Hamlet sure if he can trust the ghost?" and a "Who's Who" of the characters. The story unfolds in awe-inspiring art, from full-page spreads to revealing details. <i>Young Reader's Shakespeare</i> is a powerful visual and reading experience.<br><b><i>Adam McKeown </i></b><i>has taught Shakespeare, Renaissance culture, and writing at New York University, Clarkson University, and Princeton, and is currently a professor at Adelphi University in Long Island.</i><br><b><i>Sally Wern Comport</i></b><i> has won awards from the Society of Illustrators, Communication Arts Magazine, Print Magazine, and Spectrum. Sally's recent books include: <b>Brave Margaret, Skeleton Man, </b>and<b> The Great Expedition of Lewis and Clark.</b> She serves on the faculty of the Maryland Institute, College of Art.</i><br></p><p>Grade 5-8--In this solid retelling of the Bard's most famous tragedy and best-known play, McKeown fleshes out the story of the dark and brooding prince of Denmark who wages a war of conscience over how to properly avenge his father's murder. All of the basics are here: the interwoven complications of the fast-moving plot, the multilayered characters, and many of Shakespeare's most famous lines of dialogue. As the author states, however, this is not a version meant for the stage, but rather one intended to be read; thus, it has to explain many details of setting, action, and thought that are normally discovered by seeing the play. Nevertheless, McKeown is generally true to the original and adds details in keeping with the approach of most productions. The tale concludes with a series of questions and answers that give some background on the characters and the plot. Comport's fascinating illustrations range from sidebarlike insets of characters or story details to full spreads that delineate the major scenes. Their generally somber tones and use of shadow suit the mood of the piece, but the highly stylized faces and poses may at first seem rather distorted. Less sophisticated than Bruce Coville's version, William Shakespeare'sHamlet (Dial, 2004), this longer retelling will be a good choice for those wishing to have the Prince's story explained in fuller detail and with more modern overtones.--Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Steven Zeeland elicits astonishingly candid responses from a diverse sampling of Marines to questions about aspects of this rarely documented subculture. Their answers shed light on homoerotic bonding among Marines, hazing and institutional violence, sexual stereotypes of Marines in gay culture, how gay Marines reconcile their sexual identity with the ethos of "hard" Marine supermasculinity, Marines in all-male pornography, how Marines feel about being viewed as sex objects, and male attitudes about women in the Marine Corps.

Hern examines how the day-to-day experience of school teaches subservience, deadens children&#39;s natural love of learning, undercuts their self-esteem, and limits independent thought.</p><p>What is a 'complete' education, and how can parents foster healthy growth for children? Hern presents an argument against focussing on schools for education, presenting articles and gathering writings which show how parents can start the deschooling process and replace school emphasis with workable alternatives.

Simultaneous.</p><p>In <i>The Kid's Guide to Money: Earning It, Saving It, Spending It, Growing It, Sharing It</i>, author Steve Otfinoski achieves a complicated feat: explaining to kids (ages 9 through 12) the fundamentals of how to thrive in the American economy. Otfinoski uses an easy, informative tone, and focuses on the young entrepreneur who wants to earn money. The author promotes the joys of work, finding a job or building a business, developing advertising, and so on. Later chapters provide explanations of banks, budgets, careful consumerism, taxes, investments, and, finally, charitable donations. Throughout, Otfinoski sprinkles interesting sidebars (called Money Moment and Kid Cents) featuring odd facts about money and quotes from kids. Humorous drawings liven up the chapters, and the appendices include a detailed glossary. Cheers to Otfinoski for making what is often a dry, boring subject a fascinating opportunity for learning and fun. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i>Grade 4-8?A book that clearly explains money in terms that will interest children and encourage them to behave responsibly. After presenting practical moneymaking ideas, Otfinoski covers budgeting and standard consumer advice. Other useful information includes the difference between simple and compound interest; a succinct explanation of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds; and the three golden rules of using a credit card. A chapter on sharing encourages charitable giving of both cash and personal effort. The author avoids fictionalizing; all of his examples are from the "real world." Illustrations are limited to a few black-and-white cartoons and diagrams of deposit slips, newspaper stock reports, etc. Appendixes include lists of consumer protection agencies and volunteer organizations, an explanation of how to read stock tables, and a slightly dated bibliography. Adriane Berg and Arthur Bochner's The Totally Awesome Money Book for Kids (Newmarket, 1993) presents much of the same material in more "hip" language. Dan Fitzgibbon's All about Your Money (Atheneum, 1984; o.p.) gives more general guidelines in a somewhat drier style, with an excellent chapter on "learning to enjoy your money." Elizabeth Wilkinson's Making Cents (Little, 1989) is the best written of all, but concentrates on money-making ideas with a final chapter on money management, business ethics, etc. Oftinoski's friendly, low-key approach compares well to all of these titles.?Jonathan Betz-Zall, Sno-Isle Regional Library System, Edmonds, WA<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>France in Modern Times</h2><p><p><strong>This text charts the political history of France from the 18th century to the present, interspersing narrative with chapters on society, the economy, culture and historiography.</strong></p> This edition reflects recent research on the French Revolution, taking into account the scholarship of the "New Revisionist" school.&nbsp; It incorporates recent events in France, including an assessment of post-Socialist politics and examines the challenges facing France as a member of the European Union.</p><p>Gordon Wright is William H.

A profile of the Lost Generation captures life among the expatriates on Paris&#39; Left Bank during the 1920s, the brutality of bullfighting in Spain, and the moral and spiritual dissolution of a generation.</p><p><i>The Sun Also Rises</i> first appeared in 1926, and yet it's as fresh and clean and fine as it ever was, maybe finer. Hemingway's famously plain declarative sentences linger in the mind like poetry: "Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that." His cast of thirtysomething dissolute expatriates--Brett and her drunken fianc�, Mike Campbell, the unhappy Princeton Jewish boxer Robert Cohn, the sardonic novelist Bill Gorton--are as familiar as the "cool crowd" we all once knew. No wonder this quintessential lost-generation novel has inspired several generations of imitators, in style as well as lifestyle.<p> Jake Barnes, Hemingway's narrator with a mysterious war wound that has left him sexually incapable, is the heart and soul of the book. Brett, the beautiful, doomed English woman he adores, provides the glamour of natural chic and sexual unattainability. Alcohol and post-World War I anomie fuel the plot: weary of drinking and dancing in Paris caf�s, the expatriate gang decamps for the Spanish town of Pamplona for the "wonderful nightmare" of a week-long fiesta. Brett, with fianc� and ex-lover Cohn in tow, breaks hearts all around until she falls, briefly, for the handsome teenage bullfighter Pedro Romero. "My God! he's a lovely boy," she tells Jake. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn." Whereupon the party disbands.</p><p> But what's most shocking about the book is its lean, adjective-free style. <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> is Hemingway's masterpiece--one of them, anyway--and no matter how many times you've read it or how you feel about the manners and morals of the characters, you won't be able to resist its spell. This is a classic that really does live up to its reputation. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Bolshoi Confidential: Secrets of the Russian Ballet from the Rule of the Tsars to Today</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>Booklist</em> Editors' Choice Selection</strong></p><p><strong>An enthralling, definitive new history of the Bolshoi Ballet, where visionary performances onstage compete with political machinations backstage.</strong></p><p>On&nbsp;a freezing night in&nbsp;January&nbsp;2013, a hooded assailant hurled acid in the face of the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet. The crime, organized by a lead soloist,&nbsp;dragged&nbsp;one of Russia&#x2019;s most illustrious institutions&nbsp;into scandal. The Bolshoi Theater had&nbsp;been a&nbsp;crown jewel during the&nbsp;reign of the tsars and&nbsp;an emblem of Soviet power throughout the&nbsp;twentieth&nbsp;century. Under Putin in the twenty-first century, it&nbsp;has been called on to preserve&nbsp;a priceless artistic legacy and mirror Russia&#x2019;s neo-imperial ambitions.&nbsp;The attack and its torrid aftermath underscored the importance of the Bolshoi to the art of ballet, to Russia, and to the world.</p><p>The acid attack resonated far beyond the world of ballet, both into Russia&#x2019;s political infrastructure and, as renowned musicologist Simon Morrison shows in his tour-de-force account, the very core of the Bolshoi&#x2019;s unparalleled history. With exclusive access to&nbsp;state&nbsp;archives&nbsp;and private sources,&nbsp;Morrison&nbsp;sweeps us through the history of&nbsp;the storied ballet, describing the careers of those onstage as well as off, tracing the political ties that bind the institution to&nbsp;the&nbsp;varying Russian regimes, and detailing the birth of some of the best-loved ballets in the&nbsp;repertoire.</p><p>From&nbsp;its&nbsp;disreputable beginnings in 1776 at the hand of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Faustian charlatan,&nbsp;the Bolshoi became a point of pride for the&nbsp;tsarist empire&nbsp;after&nbsp;the defeat of Napoleon in 1812. After the revolution,&nbsp;Moscow was transformed from a merchant town to a global capital, its theater becoming a key site of power. Meetings of the Communist Party were hosted at the Bolshoi, and the Soviet Union was signed&nbsp;into existence on its stage.&nbsp;During the Soviet years, artists struggled with corrosive censorship,&nbsp;while&nbsp;ballet joined chess&nbsp;tournaments&nbsp;and&nbsp;space exploration as points of national pride&nbsp;and Cold War contest.&nbsp;Recently,&nbsp;a $680 million restoration&nbsp;has restored&nbsp;the Bolshoi to its former glory,&nbsp;even as prized talent has departed.</p><p>As Morrison reveals in lush and insightful prose, the theater has been bombed, rigged with explosives, and reinforced with cement. Its dancers have suffered unimaginable physical torment to climb the ranks, sometimes for so little money that they kept cows at home whose milk they could sell for food. But the Bolshoi&nbsp;has transcended its own fraught history, surviving&nbsp;250 years&nbsp;of artistic and political upheaval to&nbsp;define&nbsp;not only Russian culture but also ballet itself. In this sweeping, definitive account, Morrison demonstrates once and for all that, as Russia goes, so goes the Bolshoi Ballet.</p> 16 pages of illustrations</p><p>Simon Morrison is a professor of music at Princeton University, a contributor to the New York Times and the Times Literary Supplement, and the author of, most recently, Lina and Serge. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.&#x201c;The title means what it says. There&#x2019;s plenty of scandal here: arson, double suicide, dead cats flung at curtain calls. At the same time, the book is energetically researched, beautifully written &#x2015; fun, relaxed, sophisticated &#x2015; and full of serious ideas, boldly stated.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joan Acocella, dance critic, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The insider look in <em>Bolshoi Confidential</em> is incredibly rich and makes this book a page-turner...Breathtakingly complicated life stories of both people and productions parade through the pages...Its central figures, like Plisetskaya, jump off its pages complex and alive.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Daria Khitrova, <em>New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Morrison turns to the past in order to unpack the conundrum of the Bolshoi within the enigma-wrapped, mystery-obscured riddle of the Russian state...All of this makes for good, even great, fodder...Sex scandals, double-suicide pacts, bribery, arson, executions, prostitution rings, embezzlement, starving orphans, dead cats in lieu of flowers, and ballerinas refusing to shave their armpits.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Madison Mainwaring, <em>The New Republic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Masterful. . . . <em>Bolshoi Confidential</em> . . . is much more than a compendium of ballerinas behaving badly. Rather, it offers a rich, fascinating and nuanced examination of the role of the arts in Russian history, one that highlights their profound importance to the creation of a national identity and their troubled relationship with the country&#x2019;s rulers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Douglas Smith, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Simon Morrison&#x2019;s <em>Bolshoi Confidential</em> lifts the curtain on Russia&#x2019;s best-known cultural institution. An intoxicating mix of grandeur and gossip, it charts luminous performances on stage and sordid machinations in the wings from the age of Catherine the Great to that of Vladimir Putin...Sweeping and authoritative.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lucy Ash, <em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A sweeping, grandly intriguing story at the interface of art and power. . . . Morrison frames his story, always readable and brimming with curious anecdotes, with the recent, newsworthy acid attack on artistic director Sergei Filin, a strange episode that exposed not just clashes of individual personalities, but also competing views of what the Bolshoi should be, some of which may have emanated from inside the walls of the neighboring Kremlin. A must for ballet buffs . . . . [and] a look backstage that is both lively and learned.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Charming and astonishingly detailed...The Bolshoi&#x2019;s dancers, ballets, and composers, its administrators and detractors and supporters&#x2015;all are tantalizingly depicted here... Balletomanes will drool and sigh, music lovers will be fascinated...A riveting history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Another marvelously informative book from Simon Morrison, dishing this time on Russia&#x2019;s great musical theater, onstage and off. It is a wonderful read, full of intriguing spectacle and spectacular intrigue.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Taruskin, author of <em>The Oxford History of Western Music</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Simon Morrison has written an engrossing history of one of Russia&#x2019;s most enduring cultural institutions. <em>Bolshoi Confidential</em> deftly shatters the distinctions between high-brow and low-brow, art and politics, authority and violence.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Amanda Foreman, author of <em>Georgiana</em> and <em>A World on Fire</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A colorful and erudite view on Russia through the tumultuous history of the sumptuous Bolshoi.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Peter Pomeranzev, author of <em>Nothing is True and Everything is Possible</em></strong></p><h2>An Essay on Man</h2><p><p><b>A definitive new edition of one of the greatest philosophical poems in the English language</b></p><p>Voltaire called it "the most sublime didactic poem ever written in any language." Rousseau rhapsodized about its intellectual consolations. Kant recited long passages of it from memory during his lectures. And Adam Smith and David Hume drew inspiration from it in their writings. This was Alexander Pope's <i>Essay on Man</i> (1733&#x2013;34), a masterpiece of philosophical poetry, one of the most important and controversial works of the Enlightenment, and one of the most widely read, imitated, and discussed poems of eighteenth-century Europe and America. This volume, which presents the first major new edition of the poem in more than fifty years, introduces this essential work to a new generation of readers, recapturing the excitement and illuminating the debates it provoked from the moment of its publication.</p><p>Echoing Milton's purpose in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Pope says his aim in <i>An Essay on Man</i> is to "vindicate the ways of God to man"&#x2015;to explain the existence of evil and explore man's place in the universe. In a comprehensive introduction, Tom Jones describes the poem as an investigation of the fundamental question of how people should behave in a world they experience as chaotic, but which they suspect to be orderly from some higher point of view. The introduction provides a thorough discussion of the poem's attitudes, themes, composition, context, and reception, and reassesses the work's place in history. Extensive annotations to the text explain references and allusions.</p><p>The result is the most accessible, informative, and reader-friendly edition of the poem in decades and an invaluable book for students and scholars of eighteenth-century literature and thought.</p></p><p><p>"This is a definitive, reader-friendly edition of a poem that ought to be circulated as widely as possible. The textual commentary is a model of its kind--lucid, full, rich in insight, and especially good at tracking down and elucidating the allusions in which the poem abounds. The introduction is also an exemplary piece of literary scholarship."<b>--Brian Young, Christ Church College, University of Oxford</b></p><p>"Tom Jones's edition of <i>An Essay on Man</i> is an impressive achievement. His introduction and notes are deeply learned and useful. They synthesize much of what we know about the poem's composition, publication, sources, analogues, and influence, but also present fresh, original insights into its meanings and importance as a document of eighteenth-century intellectual history. The sophistication with which Jones treats the philosophical contexts of the poem is exceptional."<b>--James Noggle, Wellesley College</b></p><p>"This is a very good edition. The lively and wide-ranging introduction is attentive to both the original context and continuing relevance of Pope's poem."<b>--David Womersley, St. Catherine's College, University of Oxford</b></p><b>Tom Jones</b> teaches English at the University of St. Andrews.

The book was written at Chimney Farm, the Maine homestead immortalized in Northern Farm to which he repaired in 1931 with his wife Elizabeth Coatsworth, and where he died in 1968.<br><p><br>Beston described his efforts as "part garden book, part musing study of our relation to nature through the oldest group of plants known to gardeners." But, as Roger Swain observes in his moving introduction, "Herbs and the Earth has an intensity that evokes the herbs themselves, as if, pressed between the pages, their aroma has seeped into the pages." The book is lovingly illustrated with the woodcuts of the great American stone cutter/letter designer/craftsman John Howard Benson.</p></p><p>Beston (1888-1968), a New England naturalist and children's book author whose "chosen home" from 1944 on was a farm in Maine, here writes with an almost Proustian dedication about herbs as human "familiars" of ancient lineage. "The green life of earth is a deeper life than we know," he avows, and walks a leisurely path through species including sage, marjoram, basil and other mainstays. Always exercising a "gardener's musing mind," the author gently but firmly reproaches "the age in which we live" for having "lost the earth," and exchanged this for a "vulgar curse of gigantism," with gardens "fallen into so impersonal a rut." Writing as an appreciator of "subtleties of light" and the revelations of "a simple leaf," Beston pens a hymn in prose, out of print for a dozen years, of unusual depth and eloquence.

As various scholars have shown, the technology of the camera is not innocent, and nor are the images it produces. <br><br>In this way, the invention and continuance of the &#x201c;white race&#x201d; is not just a political, social and legal phenomenon, it is also a complexly visual one. In a time of revivified fascisms, from Donald Trump to Tommy Robinson, we must attempt to locate the image of whiteness anew, so that we can better understand its nonsensical construction. What does whiteness look like, and how might we begin to trace an anti-racist history of artistic resistance that works against it? <br><br><i>The Image of Whiteness</i> seeks to introduce its reader to some important extracts from the troubling story of whiteness, to describe its falsehoods, its paradoxes and its oppressive nature, and to highlight some of the crucial work photographic artists have done to subvert and critique its image.<br><br>Edited by writer and photography scholar Daniel C. Blight, <i>The Image of Whiteness</i> includes the work of artists Abdul Abdullah, Agata Madejska, Broomberg &amp; Chanarin, Buck Ellison, John Lucas &amp; Claudia Rankine, David Birkin, Hank Willis Thomas, Kajal Nisha Patel, Michelle Dizon &amp; Viet Le, Nancy Burson, Nate Lewis, Libita Clayton, Paul Mpagi Sepuya, Richard Misrach, Sophie Gabrielle, Stacy Kranitz and Stanley Wolukau-Wanambwa.</p></p><p>&#x201c;The Image of Whiteness&#x201d; [is] a rare text; a white man producing literature on race for a white audience without intentionally or unconsciously justifying a colonialist, imperialist, or white supremacist regime.

Making the case for the relevance of theoretical and experimental results in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence for the philosophy of mind, Churchland reviews current developments in the cognitive sciences and offers a clear and accessible account of the connections to philosophy of mind.</p><p>For this third edition, the text has been updated and revised throughout. The changes range from references to the iPhone's "Siri" to expanded discussions of the work of such contemporary philosophers as David Chalmers, John Searle, and Thomas Nagel. Churchland describes new research in evolution, genetics, and visual neuroscience, among other areas, arguing that the philosophical significance of these new findings lies in the support they tend to give to the reductive and eliminative versions of materialism.</p><p><i>Matter and Consciousness</i>, written by the most distinguished theorist and commentator in the field, offers an authoritative summary and sourcebook for issues in philosophy of mind.

Everyone's wearing black. And on-stage a tenor is blowing his heart out, a searching, jagged saxophone journey played out against a moody, walking bass and the swish of a drummer's brushes. To a great many listeners--from African American aficionados of the period to a whole new group of fans today--this is the very embodiment of jazz. It is also quintessential hard bop. In this, the first thorough study of the subject, jazz expert and enthusiast David H. Rosenthal vividly examines the roots, traditions, explorations and permutations, personalities and recordings of a climactic period in jazz history.<br> Beginning with hard bop's origins as an amalgam of bebop and R&amp;B, Rosenthal narrates the growth of a movement that embraced the heavy beat and bluesy phrasing of such popular artists as Horace Silver and Cannonball Adderley; the stark, astringent, tormented music of saxophonists Jackie McLean and Tina Brooks; the gentler, more lyrical contributions of trumpeter Art Farmer, pianists Hank Jones and Tommy Flanagan, composers Benny Golson and Gigi Gryce; and such consciously experimental and truly one-of-a-kind players and composers as Andrew Hill, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, and Charles Mingus. Hard bop welcomed all influences--whether Gospel, the blues, Latin rhythms, or Debussy and Ravel--into its astonishingly creative, hard-swinging orbit. Although its emphasis on expression and downright "badness" over technical virtuosity was unappreciated by critics, hard bop was <em>the</em> music of black neighborhoods and the last jazz movement to attract the most talented young black musicians.<br> Fortunately, records were there to catch it all. The years between 1955 and 1965 are unrivaled in jazz history for the number of milestones on vinyl. Miles Davis's <em>Kind of Blue</em>, Charles Mingus's <em>Mingus Ah Um</em>, Thelonious Monk's <em>Brilliant Corners</em>, Horace Silver's <em>Further Explorations</em>--Rosenthal gives a perceptive cut-by-cut analysis of these and other jazz masterpieces, supplying an essential discography as well. For knowledgeable jazz-lovers and novices alike, <em>Hard Bop</em> is a lively, multi-dimensional, much-needed examination of the artists, the milieus, and above all the sounds of one of America's great musical epochs.<br></p><p>In Hard Bop, the first thorough study of a brand of post-bebop jazz that included many of the most talented American musicians from roughly 1955 to 1965, David H. Rosenthal vividly examines the roots, traditions, explorations and permutations, personalities and recordings of a climactic period in jazz history. Beginning with hard bop's origins as an amalgam of bebop and R&amp;B, he describes the evolution of movement that welcomed all influences.<br> A free-lance jazz critic, <strong>David H. Rosenthal</strong> was also a poet, literary critic, journalist, and translator of Catalan and Portuguese literature. His articles on music have appeared in <em>Down Beat</em>, <em>JazzTimes</em>, <em>Keyboard</em>, the <em>Village Voice</em>, and other publications.<br></p><h2>The Samurai (New Directions Classic)</h2><p><p>One of the late Shusaku Endo&#x2019;s finest works, <em>The Samurai</em> tells of the journey of some of the first Japanese to set foot on European soil and the resulting clash of cultures and politics.</p></p><p>The Samurai, without doubt one of the late Shusaku Endo&#39;s finest works, seamlessly combines historical fact with novelist&#39;s imaginings. Set in the period preceding the Christian persecutions in Japan, The Samurai traces the steps of some of the first Japanese to set foot on European soil. Rokuemon Hasekura, a low-ranking warrior, is chosen as one of Japan&#39;s envoys to the Viceroy of Mexico and Pope Paul V. The emissaries set sail in 1613, accompanied by an ambitious Franciscan missionary who hopes to bargain trading privileges with the West for the right to head his order in Japan. The arduous journey lasts four years, and the Japanese travel from Mexico to Rome, where they are persuaded that the success of their mission depends on their conversion willy-nilly to Christianity. In fact, the enterprise has been futile from the start and the mission returns to Japan where the political tides have shifted: the authorities are pursuing an isolationist policy and a ruthless stamping out of all Western influences. In the face of disillusionment and death, samurai Rokuemon&#39;s only support and solace come from the spiritual lord he is not even sure he believes in.<p><strong>Shusaku Endo</strong> (1923&#x2013;1996) is widely regarded as one of the most important Japanese authors of the late twentieth century. He won many major literary awards and was nominated for the Nobel Prize several times. His novel <em>Silence</em> was recently made into a major film directed by Martin Scorsese.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Van C.

Yet his roots remained in the southwestern driftless area of Wisconsin. He returned to his childhood farm, Seldom Seen, in the mid-1980s, and has lived there ever since. Ben was born and raised on the farm and attended Seneca High School before studying journalism at UW-Platteville and UW-Madison. He spent 4 1/2 years in the navy during WWII on amphibious landing craft in combat in North Africa and Italy. After the war, Ben worked as a merchant seaman in Europe and South America, then returned to Wisconsin to complete his master&#39;s degree. Further travels took him to Mexico to study anthropology and creative writing. In Mexico, he met his wife. From 1960-1985, Ben was senior producer for United Methodist Communications in New York state. He won an Emmy award for best-written documentary film, Taking Children Seriously, which aired on NBC-TV in 1986. UW-Platteville gave him the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1984. His book, The Land Remembers, was published in 1975, and is now in its eighth edition. It is something of a phenomenon, and has sold nearly half a million copies. In the latest edition, two original chapters have been reunited with the story, and included in a new Afterword that brings his story about growing up on a farm in the &#39;30s full-circle, back to the land and its people. The birth of that land, like the birth of the planet, is beyond our comprehension. We can theorize about cosmic dust, planetary collisions, rivers of molten rock, land rising out of the sea to be worn down again by wind and water, but how real is all that compared to the feel of the morning sun on the face, the smell of the seasons changing, the sight of the new green springing from the soil? Ben also wrote The Empty Meadow in 1983 and Christmas Remembered.Ben Logan traveled as a merchant seaman and worked many years as a novelist, producer and writer of films and television, and lecturer while living forty miles north of New York City.

The castle, as the stronghold of the ruling shogun or the provincial feudal lord, symbolized prestige and military might and was there appropriately magnificent in structure and size. The shoin-style mansion of the samurai retainer, although less grandiose in scale, was equally a symbol of social standing and military rank. Both of these forms of architecture were characterized by great dignity of design and by a richness of interior decoration unprecedented in Japanese history. The present book concerns itself with these two architectural types, giving attention not only to their chief structural features but also to the details of their d�cor and, at the same time, painting in the dramatic historical background against which they developed. As an exposition of the castle and the shoin styles, it is invaluable, for it represents a distillation of the finest in scholarly research, and it offers an abundance of information on both extant and long since vanished buildings in these two styles. Here, for example, are such celebrated structures as Juraku-dai, castle-palace of the military dictator Toyotomi Hideyoshi; Edo Castle, seat of the Tokugawa shoguns; Nijo Castle, still one of the showplaces of Kyoto; and the daimyo mansions of Edo. Here, too, are descriptions of their lavishly decorated interiors and of the social scene for which the castle and the shoin mansion served as a stage.</p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>Midway Magic: An Oral History of America&#39;s Legendary Aircraft Carrier</h2><p>Throughout its 47-year career, the USS Midway sailed at the center of almost every international crisis and conflict in the latter half of the 20th century. Its crew set new standards of naval aviation. A captured German V-2 rocket was launched off the carrier in 1947, marking the dawn of naval missile warfare. Midway taught the Navy how to fly among the icebergs during sub-Arctic winter air operations off the coast of Greenland.

What characterizes it? This brilliant and beautifully written book dissolves the logic of a beginning based on writing, civilization, or historical consciousness and offers a model for a history that escapes the continuing grip of the Judeo-Christian time frame. Daniel Lord Smail argues that in the wake of the Decade of the Brain and the best-selling historical work of scientists like Jared Diamond, the time has come for fundamentally new ways of thinking about our past. He shows how recent work in evolution and paleohistory makes it possible to join the deep past with the recent past and abandon, once and for all, the idea of prehistory. Making an enormous literature accessible to the general reader, he lays out a bold new case for bringing neuroscience and neurobiology into the realm of history.</p><p>"This is surely a new paradigm for the study of history that will be regarded as revolutionary but which is also well justified. To my knowledge, no other book integrates the study of human history with principles of biological and cultural evolution on such an ambitious scale."&#x2015;David Sloan Wilson, author of <i>Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion and the Nature of Society</i><br><br>"This is one of the most exciting books I've read in years.

These burners use simple gas accelerators as their central operating principle. All that is needed is a $2 MIG tip and some plumbing parts. This eliminates the need for a blower to supply combustion air, allowing the burners to be built in any size. Burners are featured, which are small enough to be used for a jewelry torch or large enough to heat any ceramic kiln. Because these burners are both powerful and portable, they can be combined with low cost space age insulating materials and common containers to build light compact heating equipment. Also described is a blacksmith's forge that can be carried anywhere and stored under a workbench; a portable metal melting furnace; a portable farrier's forge; a portable glass furnace/glory hole; and a mobile hot-work station that aids in combining several crafts. The burners and equipment provide an inexpensive way to get started in blacksmithing, foundry work, ceramics, or glasswork. General information and specific designs are given, enabling the craftsperson to build equipment tailored to their own desires.</p><p>Mike began learning ornamental ironwork at twelve in his father&#x2019;s shop during the fifeties building boom.

Wilson, 10 February 2004</i></p><h2>The Men of Brewster Place: A Novel</h2><p>Naylor returns to the fictional neighborhood, this time focusing on the men behind the women who inhabited that desolate block of row houses, telling their tragic, sad, funny, and heroic stories.</p><p>Gloria Naylor revisits the dilapidated brick walls, sagging ceilings, and decrepit plumbing of Brewster Place, a feeble fortress that jealously guards the hell, heartache, and hope of its tenants. Ben, the kind, alcoholic janitor from <i>The Women of Brewster Place</i> returns as a mythical minstrel of sorts, wandering in and out of the lives of Brewster's male denizens, introducing their stories, each a quest for the meaning of <i>manhood</i>.<p>For autistic Brother Jerome, masculine identity comes in the form of a rickety upright piano whose missing keys and wobbly wires burst to life when he plays. Jerome plays so well (better than Count Basie, mind you) that his hedonistic mother decides not to institutionalize him so she can charge for his performances. Eugene, however, has a more difficult act to shore: he's married, he's a father, and he's gay. Ceil, his wife, doesn't know that's why he keeps leaving, so she takes family matters into her own hands and sends Eugene into a bottomless pit of guilt and self-loathing. Basil looks for his redemption in a contemptuous trash bag named Keisha and her two beautiful, neglected sons, Jason and Eddie. Will Basil find atonement for his sins against his mother if he gives those boys what he never received as a child? The men of Brewster Place continue to stream into the story in raw, biting vignettes until the stage is full and the future of their community is threatened. Can these men come together and reclaim what's theirs? The answer lies at the root of self-worth and sexual identity. Or, in the words of Ben, "Brewster Place is a small street but it seems there's an endless supply of I coulda, I shoulda, but didn't. Can you call it any man's blues? I don't know, but you can definitely call it the black man's blues." <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>The Women of Brewster Place launched Gloria Naylor and was filmed for television. Now the author returns to the housing project on Brewster with a similar series of first-person narratives of its male inhabitants. Joe Morton--an excellent, if colorless, actor--impersonates these men, while the author herself bridges each section as the spirit of the place. Both do a nice job--especially Morton, who reins in the book&#39;s melodrama and sentimentality. Y.R.

What was the Impressionist who painted them trying to capture? And did he have enough money to pay for his lunch? These are the kinds of questions applied to the masterpieces collected in this book. The result is an unusual account of trends and lifestyles of times past as reflected in great works of art.</p><p>This book presents a selection of articles originally published in the German magazine art by the Hagens, who also produced a TV series, History in Paintings, as part of their mission to make art more understandable to nonspecialists. The 32 essays, each focusing on a work by a different artist, are arranged chronologically from the 15th through the 20th centuries. With the exceptions of Diego Rivera, Vasily Surikov, and Edward Kienholz, the artists are all from Western Europe. Large color plates enhance the text, and a graphic technique is used to highlight a particular area of the paintings like a window and draw viewers deeper into the work. The authors discuss how these details reflect the political events, religious views, sexual mores, and social issues of the times.

He was very much a man of his time and place, and this new biography, the first to be written in English since 1930, places the great actor/playwright in his historical context as the son of well-to-do bourgeois and student at the Jesuit College de Clermont in the 1630&#39;s, as one of a group of stage-struck hopefuls and as a vagabond actor in the provinces in the 1640&#39;s and 50&#39;s, and--from 1658 to his death in 1673--as a clever courtier, a faithful friend, a not-so-faithful lover, a successful and controversial playwright striking out against hypocrisy in religion and medicine, and a cynical survivor of the literary, cultural, and marital wars.

Jerome&#39;s Three Men in a Boat includes an introduction and notes by Jeremy Lewis in Penguin Classics. Martyrs to hypochondria and general seediness, J. and his friends George and Harris decide that a jaunt up the Thames would suit them to a &#39;T&#39;. But when they set off, they can hardly predict the troubles that lie ahead with tow-ropes, unreliable weather forecasts and tins of pineapple chunks - not to mention the devastation left in the wake of J.&#39;s small fox-terrier Montmorency. Three Men in a Boat was an instant success when it appeared in 1889, and, with its benign escapism, authorial discursions and wonderful evocation of the late-Victorian &#39;clerking classes&#39;, it hilariously captured the spirit of its age. In his introduction, Jeremy Lewis examines Jerome K. Jerome&#39;s life and times, and the changing world of Victorian England he depicts - from the rise of a new mass-culture of tabloids and bestselling novels to crazes for daytripping and bicycling. Jerome K. Jerome (1859-1927) was born in Walstall, Staffordshire, and educated at Marylebone Grammar School. He left school at fourteen to become a railway clerk, the first in a long line of jobs that included actor, teacher and journalist. His first book, On Stage and Off, a collection of humorous pieces about the theatre, was published in 1885, and was followed the year after with the more commercially-successful The Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow; but it was with Three Men in a Boat (1889) that Jerome achieved lasting fame. He later went on to become one of the founders of the humorous magazine, The Idler, and continued to write articles and plays. If you enjoyed Three Men in a Boat, you might like Stella Gibbons&#39;s Cold Comfort Farm, also available in Penguin Classics.</p><p>Jerome K Jerome (1859-1927) became an actor and published a couple of volumes of humorous pieces and light essays about the theatre. He achieved lasting fame with THREE MEN IN A BOAT. He later went on to become one of the founders of the humorous magazine, The Idler, and continued to write articles and plays.

The author explores assessment theories and research findings as they affect teaching and learning, and examines why, when, and how teachers should use assessment in the classroom. To the text's hundreds of practical examples are added checklists to aid in evaluating assessment vehicles and scores of strategies for assessing higher-order thinking, critical-thinking, and problem-solving skills.</p> <p> <b>NEW TO THIS EDITION:</b> </p> <ul> <li> NEW - <b>Coverage of current topics in assessment including: formative assessment, differentiated instruction, response to intervention, universal design, and using technology for accommodations<b>.</b> </b> </li><li> NEW - <b>Two new appendices: </b>Implementing the Principles of Universal Design via Technology-Based Testing and Answers to Even-numbered Exercises </li><li> NEW - <b>Additional practical examples of classroom assessment &#x201c;as it happens&#x201d;</b>&#x2013;Throughout the text.

It focuses directly on the professional practices of elementary and secondary schoolteachers. It is a core text written for a first course in educational testing and constructing classroom assessments. It serves equally as the textbook for an undergraduate course or a first graduate course in educational assessment. No formal course work in statistics or college mathematics is necessary to understand the text. </p><p> In preparing this edition, a new effort was made to make it easy for the reader to apply the material to classroom practice through clear explanations, many practical examples and illustrations, checklists, and step-by-step how-to instructions. As with previous editions, I have written the text from the viewpoint that teaching and assessment should blend together. To help students with real-world experiences, Internet website addresses have been added throughout to help students to quickly link to examples and resources outside the text. </p><p> The book covers basic concepts as well as a complete treatment of educational assessment&#x2014;from developing plans that integrate teaching and assessment; to crafting objective, performance, and portfolio assessments; to evaluating students and discussing evaluations with parents; to interpreting state-mandated tests and standardized achievement tests. </p><p> It is important in a first course that students receive a balanced treatment of the topics. Thus, both the strengths and limitations of each assessment technique are explained. Research is cited that supports or refutes assessment and teaching practices. </p><p> This edition focuses more dearly on classroom assessment than the previous edition. Each chapter was revised with the goal of making the material more relevant to the practical issues teachers face. For example, mandated state programs have placed more emphasis on teachers aligning their classroom practices and assessments with state content and performance standards. In each chapter, I integrate suggestions for how to accomplish this alignment. </p><p> The book treats teachers as professionals. It recognizes that teachers' experiences and judgments are necessary for proper and valid use of educational assessment. I do not hesitate to point out teachers' erroneous judgments and assessment abuses, however, where good lessons can be learned from them. To ensure that the text material is in keeping with the competencies and standards held to be important by the profession, each chapter is keyed to the American Federation of Teachers, the National Council on Measurement in Education, and the National Education Association Standards for Teacher Competence in Educational Assessment of Students (reproduced in Appendix A). Organization of the Text </p><p> As in the previous edition, this book is organized into three parts. Part One provides the foundation for classroom assessment. Part Two centers on how to plan and craft classroom assessments. Part Three discusses how to interpret and use standardized tests. </p><p> Each chapter begins with a list of learning targets that the reader should attain. Each learning target is keyed to the Standards for Teacher Competence in Educational Assessment of Students. Following the body of each chapter is a summary in list form to help the reader recall information. Each chapter concludes with a list of important concepts and terms, a set of exercises and discussion questions, and a brief annotated list of additional readings. Many of the exercises at the end of the chapters are performance tasks. These require applying and extending the principles taught in the chapter. Readers are often encouraged to compare their exercise results with those of others in the course to obtain greater insight into a topic. Instructors can use these exercises as a basis for in-class activities. </p><p> Part I, The Bases for Assessment in the Classroom, contains five chapters presenting the foundations for educational assessment. Chapter 1 discusses classroom decision making and how assessments help to improve it. It provides a brief overview of the assessment landscape, so the reader can see the broader picture of educational assessment before delving into specifics. Chapter 2 discusses goals and learning targets of classroom instruction. The chapter is simplified in this edition by presenting fewer cognitive taxonomies than the previous edition. New to this edition is a discussion of how state standards can be used to develop classroom teaming targets for day-to-day teaching. Chapter 3 discusses the validity of assessment results. The chapter has been simplified to focus exclusively on the current conceptions of validity held by the profession. One part of the chapter focuses exclusively on the validity of the results of teacher-crafted assessments, the other on the validity of other assessment results a teacher and a school will use. Chapter 4 describes reliability. The order of presentation of the topics has been improved to make the material flow better for the reader. Chapter 5 discusses teachers', students', and administrators' ethical responsibilities and uses of assessments. It applies the National Council on Measurement in Education's Code of Professional Responsibilities in Educational Measurement (reproduced in Appendix C) as an organizational framework. Also, this chapter describes legal issues regarding assessment and how assessments can be made to validly accommodate mainstreamed learners. </p><p> Part II, Crafting and Using Classroom Assessments, demonstrates how a teacher uses artistry and functionality to produce useful teaching tools. The ten chapters in this part provide complete coverage of how to craft virtually all types of assessments a teacher may need to use. Chapter 6 has been extensively rewritten to show clearly how teaching, assessing, and grading fit together. There are new examples showing how several different methods of assessment can be integrated into lesson plans, be matched with assessment purpose, and provide formative and summative assessment throughout an instructional unit. Chapter 7 discusses completion and true-false items, including multiple true-false items. Chapter 8 discusses how to craft multiple-choice and matching exercises. In this edition, material on alternative formats of objective items, such as masterlist and tabular matching exercises, have been integrated into this chapter. Chapter 9 focuses on crafting and marking essay items. Chapter 10 is devoted to assessing higher-order thinking skills, including problem solving and critical thinking. The presentation is simplified from the previous edition. </p><p> Two chapters are devoted to alternative and performance assessments in schools. Chapter 11 describes the basic concepts and major components of authentic and performance assessments. It surveys the many different types of performance assessments and projects that are currently used in schools. New to this edition is classroom assessment using the Multiple Intelligences Theory framework. Chapter 12 focuses exclusively on crafting and evaluating performance assessments and portfolios. The chapter shows how to craft the tasks, scoring rubrics, and rating scales necessary to produce valid results. The chapter applies the Dimensions of Learning Model as a framework for performance assessment design. Different methods of crafting rubrics are discussed. Chapter 13 focuses entirely on format, informal classroom assessment for purposes of diagnosing why a student is having difficulty learning. It shows how six different diagnostic assessment approaches may be integrated into the teaching process. Chapter 14 has been simplified, but is still about administering assessments, helping students do their best on assessments, and improving assessment tasks through item analysis. Item analysis for open-response items is new in this edition. </p><p> Chapter 15 has been extensively rewritten. It is organized in five major sections. Section One provides background for grading including grading and continuous assessment, formative and summative student assessment, and how various stakeholders use grades. Section Two presents various options that schools use to report student progress, including report cards, parent-teacher conferences, and&#x2014;new to this edition&#x2014;narrative reports. Section Three focuses on sensible grading practices that result in valid summative grades for students. The chapter provides teachers with the tools for creating a grading philosophy that is logically consistent with both their teaching approach and their purposes for assessing students. The tools integrate all the planning considerations discussed in earlier chapters. As a result, teachers can use a coherent and sensible grading model. Linking grades to teaching and assessment plans; and discussions of special problems in grading, such as using zeros and the unclear meaning of failure, are new to this edition. Section Five shows how to set grade boundaries and combine scores</p></p><h2>Essential Elements of Public Speaking (6th Edition)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Public Speaking</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>A streamlined approach to public speaking essentials</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Essential Elements of Public Speaking</i> </b> employs an efficient approach to help beginning students master the key skills of the effective public speaker.

From soldiers and statesmen to farmers and firing lines, <i>Everyday Life During the Civil War</i> offers an in-depth exploration of this fascinating era. <p>Using dozens of illustrations, timelines and maps, Michael J. Varhola illuminates the details of Northern and Southern economy; town and country living; food and the impact of war on diet; popular entertainment; clothing; military life; tools and weapons; slang and much more. </p><p>Also includes a thorough appendix of resources, featuring books, websites, historic locations and living history organizations.</p></p><p>More than any other episode in U.S. History, the Civil War has captivated the interest of people in the United States and beyond. Over the course of four years, this conflict evolved from unpredictable political turmoil into massive total war that claimed the lives of more than 600,000 Americans (more than all U.S. personnel killed in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War combined) and that has, arguably, done more to influence the course of our nation than has any other single event. <p>Today, an unprecedented number of people are interested in the American Civil War, fueling the creation of movies, documentaries, history books, and novels about the "War Between the States." Movies like <i>Gettysburg</i> and <i>Glory</i> gained instant followings; Ken Burns' PBS documentary <i>The Civil War</i> is considered by many to be one of the best documentaries ever made; and novels about the Civil War, such as <i>The Killer Angels, Gods and Generals,</i>and <i>Cold Mountain</i>, are regularly on the best seller lists. Indeed, since the Civil War ended in 1865, more non-fiction books and novels have been written about it than about any other war involving the United States. </p><p>This fascination with the Civil War has persisted for more than 130 years and is not likely to fade any time soon. One reason for this fervent interest is the proximity of the war's events to the everyday lives of so many modern Americans. </p><p><i>Everyday Life During the Civil War</i> is intended to be a broad-based introduction to the day-to-day conditions, attitudes, and events of the period. For some, this book may be the only tool they need to research the Civil War, or one of just a few, while for others it will serve as one resource among many and a guide toward finding others. </p><p>While the war was fought from 1861 to 1865, it is a bit contrived to imagine that this period existed in a vacuum. Thus, the years 1859 to 1877 are also covered to some extent, from John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, Virginia, through the end of Reconstruction. </p><p>Resources provided in this book include an overview of the North and South before, during, and after the war; descriptions of life during the war, including what people ate, what they wore, the sort of work they did, how they entertained themselves, and where they got their information; an overview of the opposing armies and the soldiers who fought in them; a timeline that describes the major events and battles of the war and its aftermath in chronological order; examples of songs and poems composed during the Civil War; resources readers can use to do further research into specific aspects of the Civil War; and an overview of Civil War reenactors and living historian. </p><p>Depending on the historical depths the reader seeks, additional information may be needed. For example, the timeline covers all the major battles of the war, but only briefly. Thus, readers who seek information about specific military actions, such as battles or campaigns, should read more in-depth descriptions of them in history books or memoirs. In any case, this book is intended to be a useful tool in the hands of anyone interested in one of the most interesting aspects of American history.</p>Michael J. Varhola is the founder of <i>Living History</i> magazine and the webmaster for a number of websites, including Living History Online, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine, and KoreanWar.net. Other books he has written or contributed to include <i>The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference</i> and <i>1950 Facts About the Korean War</i>.

Authoritative, up-to-date, conceptually rich, and laden with practical suggestions, it is 'must' reading for trainees, graduate students, clinicians, and investigators of treatment efficacy and effectiveness. This work will be cited for years to come as a landmark in the development of empirically supported and evidence-based interventions for youth."--Stephen P. Hinshaw, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"In this scholarly, provocative, engaging, and timely book, editors Kazdin and Weisz score big once again. They and their contributing authors, a veritable 'who's who' in the field, nicely bridge the gap--or some would say chasm--between treatment outcome research and clinical practice with children and adolescents. The current state of child and adolescent psychotherapy research and practice comes alive in this volume. After many years of neglect, at least in comparison to treatment outcome studies with adults, we can now be assured that we are on the right road to improved and accountable care for the children, adolescents, and families we serve. This is a volume that will be welcomed by seasoned clinicians, beginning clinicians, and graduate clinicians-in-training. It has much to offer all of us."--Thomas H. Ollendick, PhD, Department of Psychology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University<br><br>"Kazdin and Weisz have assembled a stellar group of researchers to provide up-to-date information about evidence-based psychotherapies for many of the major mental disorders of childhood and adolescence. Details regarding treatment implementation, training and supervision of therapists, relevance to clinical practice, clinical challenges, and future research directions are described for each therapy. This volume is a 'must' for clinicians, clinical researchers, and others involved in the care of children and adolescents with mental health problems. In addition, it is a wonderful resource for clinical child psychology graduate students and child and adolescent psychiatry residents."--Howard Abikoff, PhD, NYU Child Study Center and Department of Psychiatry, New York University<br></p><h2>Before Time Could Change Them: The Complete Poems of Constantine P. Cavafy</h2><p>Since his death almost seventy years ago, C. P. Cavafy has come to be recognized as one of the greatest poets of modern times. Elegiac, deeply sensual, and able to plumb the heart with language of immense richness, Cavafy evokes the great lost classical world of the Mediterranean with unparalleled beauty. Much of his poetry deals with love, specifically homosexual love. It speaks of human passions, the experience common to all mankind of love offered, sought, and lost. His verse is beautiful and embracing, and remains as alive and sensuous as it was when he wrote it.<br><br>Theoharis Constantine Theoharis offers a new translation, one that presents Cavafy's work in the thematic order Cavafy wanted it published and emphasizes the tenderness and intensity of the love poems. Gore Vidal's foreword offers an explication of Cavafy's world, a valuable map for readers of what will be embraced as a signal volume of world poetry.<br> <br></p><p>Constantine P.

A Jason Aronson Book</p><p>Samuel Yochelson, Ph.D., M.D., was until his death in 1976, director of the Program for the Investigation of Criminal Behavior at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, Washington, D.C. and research professor of clinical psychiatry at George Washington University School of Medicine Stanton E. Samenow, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist in Alexandria, Virginia. He is also the co-author of The Criminal Personality, Volume II: The Change Process, and The Criminal Personality: Volume I, A Profile for Change.The basic defect of traditional treatment systems is the persisting concept that criminals think and reason as non-criminals do and that they, therefore, respond similarly to both reasoning and love. Yochelson and Samenow have definitely profiled the characteristics of the errors of criminal thinking, together with their derivatives&#x2015;feeling and behavior. They show persuasively that because of ingrained and pervasive errors of thinking, criminals live and act in a world with entirely different assumptivebases than those of non-criminals. The authors then proceed to develop a treatment program using a phenomenological process. This exhaustive and painstaking study marks a turning point in the history of efforts to rehabilitate criminals... (W. Edward Naugler M.D.)<br><br>The Criminal Personality is important reading for you. It is an often devastating book that is uncompromising in its refection of conventional wisdom in the field of criminal psychology. It rejects the concept of the criminal as biopsychosocial victim, and in its place formulates an accountability theory based on the premise that criminals freely choose and prefer lives of crime.... (Tim Murphy)<br><br>The Criminal Personality is a seminal work that provides challenge to mental health professionals to alter their preconceptions in dealing with criminals, and gives correctional counselors a blueprint to begin the serious work of criminal rehabilitation. One by one the cherished myths of sociology and psychology regarding the origins of criminality are discarded, since the authors find that rationalizations of broken family, racial oppression, bad companions, and lack opportunity' are utilized by criminals to justify continued nonresponsibility for their own behavior...

Event-Cities C4 follows directly from the work of<i>Event-Cities 3</i>, which examined the interaction of architectural content, concept, and context. This volume takes the interaction a step further, looking at a series of projects for which program or context are insufficient as a generative conceptual strategy, hence requiring a different approach. Tschumi has said, &#x201c;Over the past years, there is one word I have almost never used, except in order to attack it: 'form.'&#x201d; In <i>Event-Cities 4</i>, Tschumi introduces the &#x201c;concept-form&#x201d;: a concept generating a form, or a form generating a concept, so that one reinforces the other. The concept may be programmatic, technological, or social. The form may be singular or multiple, regular or irregular.

This colorfully written, lavishly illustrated book surveys how Jews have participated in--and been identified with--American movies, radio, and television from the nickelodeon era at the turn of the twentieth century to the present day.</p><br><p> Throughout, the tone is lively, the design is playful, and key points are visually enhanced by stills, publicity photos, and memorabilia. This anthology of original analyses and primary texts covers a wide range of topics, including the multiple versions of <i>The Jazz Singer</i>, the saga of the Hollywood movie moguls, the irrepressible Goldbergs of radio and television fame, the representation of the Holocaust, how Charlie Chaplin and other non-Jewish stars became "virtual Jews," and the dazzling success of the television series <i>Seinfeld</i>.

It takes the form of a broad movement away from classical psychoanalytic theorizing grounded in Freud's drive theory toward models of mind and development grounded in object relations concepts. In clinical practice, there has been a corresponding movement away from the classical principles of neutrality, abstinence and anonymity toward an interactive vision of the analytic situation that places the analytic relationship, with its powerful, reciprocal affective currents, in the foreground. These developments have been evident in virtually all schools of psychoanalysis in America, from the most traditional to the most radical.</p> <p>Collected together for the first time, this three volume set brings together this ongoing project for a new audience.</p> <p><em>Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition</em> (Volume 1) - Each paper in Volume 1 is accompanied by an introduction, in which the editors place it in its historical context, and a new afterward, in which the author suggests subsequent developments in his or her thinking. This book is an invaluable resource for any clinical practitioner, teacher or student of psychoanalysis interested in exploring the exciting developments of recent years.</p> <p><em>Relational Psychoanalysis: Innovation and Expansion</em> (Volume 2) - Volume 2 brings together key papers of the recent past that exemplify the continuing growth and refinement of the relational sensibility. In selecting these papers, editors Lewis Aron and Adrienne Harris have stressed the shared relational dimension of different psychoanalytic traditions, and they have used such commonalities to structure the best recent contributions to the literature. The topics covered in Volume 2 reflect both the evolution of psychoanalysis and the unique pathways that leading relational writers have been pursuing and in some cases establishing.</p> <p><em>Relational Psychoanalysis: New Voices</em> (Volume 3) - Volume 3 is a forum for new relational voices and new idioms of relational discourse. Established writers, Muriel Dimen, Sue Grand, and Ruth Stein among them, utilize aspects of their own subjectivity to illuminate heretofore neglected dimensions of cultural experience, of trauma, and of clinical stalemate. A host of new voices applies relational thinking to aspects of race, class, and politics as they emerge in the clinical situation.</p></p><p><p>Robert D.

The authors have great respect for the process of the clinical situation and the need to develop theories which conform to direct experiences with patients.

McGurl asks both how the patronage of the university has reorganized American literature and&#x2014;even more important&#x2014;how the increasing intimacy of writing and schooling can be brought to bear on a reading of this literature. </p><p> </p><p> McGurl argues that far from occasioning a decline in the quality or interest of American writing, the rise of the creative writing program has instead generated a complex and evolving constellation of aesthetic problems that have been explored with energy and at times brilliance by authors ranging from Flannery O&#x2019;Connor to Vladimir Nabokov, Philip Roth, Raymond Carver, Joyce Carol Oates, and Toni Morrison. </p><p> </p><p> Through transformative readings of these and many other writers, <i>The Program Era</i> becomes a meditation on systematic creativity&#x2014;an idea that until recently would have seemed a contradiction in terms, but which in our time has become central to cultural production both within and beyond the university. </p><p> </p><p> An engaging and stylishly written examination of an era we thought we knew, <i>The Program Era</i> will be at the center of debates about postwar literature and culture for years to come. </p></p><p>Mark McGurl is a Professor of English at Stanford University.It is a clich� to say that a book so changes your view of a particular historical period or problem that you never see it the same old way again. But this is the kind of book that warrants such praise. McGurl has brought deep learning, sweeping ambition, and stylistic brio together here to produce a whole new story of postwar American fiction. There is nothing else like it on the shelves of contemporary literary criticism. (Jim English, author of <i>The Economy of Prestige: Prizes, Awards, and the Circulation of Cultural Value</i>)<br><br><i>The Program Era</i> is a brilliant book of great ambition and originality. It will be rightly regarded as a landmark work and will shape the critical understanding of postwar American literature and culture for many years to come. (Sean McCann, author of <i>A Pinnacle of Feeling: American Literature and Presidential Government</i>)<br><br><i>The Program Era</i> juxtaposes an unlikely cast of writers between its covers: Flannery O&#x2018;Connor, Toni Morrison, Thomas Pynchon, Raymond Carver, Philip Roth, George Saunders, and on. McGurl positions this diverse crew squarely in the context of the remarkable growth of creative writing programs in the U.S. after World War Two. McGurl&#x2018;s reinterpretation of these writers, whom scholars have so often read separately from one another, promises to unsettle all the standard ways literary historians carve up the postwar world of letters. McGurl has a rare talent for writing literary criticism that smuggles its theoretical concepts into your brain under the cover of lucid and readable and unpretentious prose. Academic literary critics, perhaps by necessity, spend lots of time becoming specialists in their patch of intellectual turf and speaking only to each other in an ever-subdividing glossolalia of theory. If we're lucky, McGurl&#x2018;s book will inaugurate for us a new genre of literary history that, though wholly intelligible to the general reader, doesn't pull its punches or water down the complexity of its vision. (Lee Konstantinou, <i>The Believer</i>)<br><br>The institutionalized teaching of creative writing thrives in America. In Mark McGurl's wide-ranging, audacious study, the academy comes to define postwar fiction in surprising ways. You won't think of most of your favorite authors quite the same way again. (Ed Park, author of <i>Personal Days</i>)<br><br>[There's] much food for thought in what [McGurl] has to say about literary trends. Most, interesting, though, is his sensitive exploration of the interplay between individual writers and the Creative Writing programs...Opinionated and lively...He delivers a cornucopia of exciting new ideas and insights in a work which will be indispensable reading for teachers and students of creative writing, and for anyone interested in modern fiction...[A] complex, energetic and fascinating book. (�il�s N� Dhuibhne <i>Irish Times</i> 2009-04-18)<br><br>McGurl does have some smart things to say about the evolution of this creative writing movement--he documents it as part of the rise of progressive education in general--and about the many paradoxes involved when universities get in the business of trying to structure, codify and reward artistic endeavor. (Charles McGrath <i>New York Times</i> 2009-04-19)<br><br>What has the movement of postwar writing into the university done to our literature?...The obvious nature of this question only places the decades-long lack of a proper answer in higher relief. It is proportionately exhilarating to find, in Mark McGurl's <i>The Program Era</i>, a brilliant and comprehensive mind developing one at last. McGurl trains his gaze on the university writing programs and some of the masterful novelists they have incubated. But he makes his most compelling arguments at the level of the writer's practical place in the academy, examining the distorting (and enabling) effects of university discipline on individual artists, and considering the wider role of "creative writing" within a chain of notions of creativity (lasting from high school to the service-economy workplace) that inculcate skills for late-capitalist life...McGurl gives the best account I have seen of [Flannery] O'Connor's cruel maximization of "ironic distance"; in her third-person narration, she aspires, as he puts it, almost "to the unimaginable condition of fourth person narration--narration from a higher dimension." His pages on Raymond Carver and '80s minimalism, a mode that "came to be seen, oversimplifing the case drastically, as the 'house style' of the creative writing program," are similarly unrivaled...McGurl's clear-sighted exposure of the hidden institutional background of postwar literary production is one of the first reliable signs that we will finally see that era thoroughly anatomized in a new generation of scholarship. (Mark Greif <i>Bookforum</i> 2009-06-01)<br><br>McGurl's book is not a history of creative-writing programs. It's a history of twentieth-century fiction, in which the work of American writers from Thomas Wolfe to Bharati Mukherjee is read as reflections of, and reflections on, the educational system through which so many writers now pass...<i>The Program Era</i> is an impressive and imaginative book. (Louis Menand <i>New Yorker</i> 2009-06-08)<br><br>McGurl performs a complicated series of critical and interpretive maneuvers in <i>The Program Era</i>. He describes in detail how the institutionalization of creative writing "has transformed the conditions under which American literature is produced" and how that has "converted the Pound Era into the Program Era." (Jennifer Howard <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> 2009-06-29)<br><br>[A] fascinating and (at times) beautifully argued book...[It] introduced me to many forgotten or unfairly neglected authors whose books I will seek out, as well as provocatively repositioning unlikely authors such as Raymond Carver as academic intellectuals.

Since no one has had the vision to see the entire beast, everyone has grabbed hold of some part or other and "railed on in utter ignorance" about the rest. We certainly do not get an elephant by adding up its parts. An elephant is more than that. Yet to comprehend the whole we also need to understand the parts.<br><br>The next ten chapters describe ten parts of our strategy-formation beast. Each forms one "school of thought." These ten chapters are framed by this first chapter, which introduces the schools as well as some ideas about strategy itself, and a last chapter which returns to the whole beast.<br><br><b>Why Ten?</b><br><br>In a colorful article entitled "The Magic Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information," psychologist George Miller (1956) asked why we tend to favor a quantity of about seven for categorizing things -- for example seven wonders of the world, seven deadly sins, and seven days of the week. This reflects our cognitive makeup, he concluded: seven is about the number of "chunks" of information that we can comfortably retain in our short-term memories. Three wonders of the world would fall a little flat, so to speak, while eighteen would be daunting. But those of us interested in strategy are, of course, no ordinary mortals -- at least in terms of our cognitive capacities -- and so should be able to comprehend, say, one more than the magic number seven plus two. Accordingly, this book proposes ten schools of thought on strategy formation.<br><br>Cognition aside, in reviewing a large body of literature, ten distinct points of view did emerge, most of which are reflected in management practice. Each has a unique perspective that focuses, like each of the blind men, on one major aspect of the strategy-formation process. Each of these perspectives is, in one sense, narrow and overstated. Yet in another sense, each is also interesting and insightful. An elephant may not be a trunk, but it certainly has a trunk, and it would be difficult to comprehend elephants without reference to trunks. The handicap of blindness does have an unexpected advantage, sharpening the other senses to the subtleties that can escape those who see clearly.<br><br>THE SCHOOLS. Accordingly, in each of the ten subsequent chapters, we present one of the schools from its own limited perspective. Then we critique it, to extract both its limitations and its contributions. These schools, together with the single adjective that seems best to capture each one's view of the strategy process, are listed below:<br><br>The Design School: strategy formation as a process of <i>conception</i><br><br>The Planning School: strategy formation as a <i>formal</i> process<br><br>The Positioning School: strategy formation as an <i>analytical</i> process<br><br>The Entrepreneurial School: strategy formation as a <i>visionary</i> process<br><br>The Cognitive School: strategy formation as a <i>mental</i> process<br><br>The Learning School: strategy formation as an <i>emergent</i> process<br><br>The Power School: strategy formation as a process of <i>negotiation</i><br><br>The Cultural School: strategy formation as a <i>collective</i> process<br><br>The Environmental School: strategy formation as a <i>reactive</i> process<br><br>The Configuration School: strategy formation as a process of <i>transformation</i><br><br>Our ten schools fall into three groupings. The first three schools are <i>prescriptive</i> in nature -- more concerned with how strategies <i>should</i> be formulated than with how they necessarily <i>do</i> form. The first of these, which presented in the 1960s the basic framework on which the other two built, focuses on strategy formation as a process of informal <i>design,</i> essentially one of conception. The second school, which developed in parallel in the 1960s and peaked in a flurry of publications and practice in the 1970s, formalized that perspective, seeing strategy making as a more detached and systematic process of formal <i>planning.</i> That school was somewhat displaced in the 1980s by the third prescriptive school, less concerned with the process of strategy formation than with the actual content of strategies. It is referred to as the <i>positioning</i> school because it focuses on the selection of strategic positions in the economic marketplace.<br><br>The six schools that follow consider specific aspects of the process of strategy formation, and have been concerned less with prescribing ideal strategic behavior than with <i>describing</i> how strategies do, in fact, get made.<br><br>Some prominent writers have long associated strategy with <i>entrepreneurship,</i> and have described the process in terms of the creation of vision by the great leader. But if strategy can be personalized vision, then strategy formation has also to be understood as the process of concept attainment in a person's head. Accordingly, a small but important cognitive school has also developed that seeks to use the messages of cognitive psychology to enter the strategist's mind.<br><br>Each of the four schools that follow has tried to open up the process of strategy formation beyond the individual, to other forces and other actors. For the <i>learning</i> school, the world is too complex to allow strategies to be developed all at once as clear plans or visions. Hence strategies must emerge in small steps, as an organization adapts, or "learns." Similar to this, but with a different twist, is the <i>power</i> school, which treats strategy formation as a process of negotiation, whether by conflicting groups within an organization or by organizations themselves as they confront their external environments. In contrast to this is another school of thought that considers strategy formation to be rooted in the <i>culture</i> of the organization. Hence the process is viewed as fundamentally collective and cooperative. And then there are the proponents of an <i>environmental</i> school, organization theorists who believe strategy formation is a reactive process in which the initiative ties not inside the organization, but with its external context. Accordingly, they seek to understand the pressures imposed on organizations.<br><br>Our final group contains but one school, although it could be argued that this school really combines the others. We call it <i>configuration.</i> People in this school, in seeking to be integrative, cluster the various elements of our beast -- the strategy-making process, the content of strategies, organizational structures and their contexts -- into distinct stages or episodes, for example, of entrepreneurial growth or stable maturity, sometimes sequenced over time to describe the life cycles of organizations. But if organizations settle into stable states, then strategy making has to describe the leap from one state to another. And so, another side of this school describes the process as one of transformation, which incorporates much of the huge prescriptive literature and practice on "strategic change."<br><br>These schools have appeared at different stages in the development of strategic management. A few have already peaked and declined, others are now developing, and some remain as thin but nonetheless significant trickles of publication and practice. We shall describe each school in turn, with our own interpretation of its development and its difficulties, before concluding with our final integrative comments in the closing chapter.<br><br>Note that all of these schools can be found in the literature, often in very clearly delineated pockets: particular academic journals, special practitioner magazines, certain styles of books. But most are, or have been, equally evident in practice, both within organizations and from the consulting firms that serve them. Practitioners read and are influenced by the literature, just as the literature is influenced by the practice. So this is a book of the school of thought on strategy formation both in publication and in practice.<br><br><b>A Field Review</b><br><br>The literature of strategic management is vast -- the number of items we reviewed over the years numbers close to 2,000 -- and it grows larger every day. Of course, not all of this comes from the field of management. All kinds of other fields make important contributions to our understanding of the strategy process.<br><br>William Starbuck has written that to discuss "all aspects of organization which are relevant to adaptation...means...that one could legitimately discuss everything that has been written about organizations." This is, in fact, an understatement, because the last word in the quotation should read "collective systems of all kinds."<br><br>What biologists write about the adaptation of species (for example it "punctuated equilibrium") can have relevance for our understanding of strategy as position ("niche"). What historians conclude about periods in the development of societies (such as "revolution") can help explain different stages in the development of organizational strategies (for example, "turnaround" as a form of "cultural revolution"). Physicists' descriptions of quantum mechanics and mathematicians' theories of chaos may provide insights into how organizations change. And so on. Add to this all the other literatures that are more commonly recognized as relevant to the study of organizations -- psychology on human cognition as well as leadership charisma, anthropology on cultures in society, economics on industrial organization, urban planning on formal planning processes, political science on public policy making, military history on strategies of conflict, and on -- and the result is an enormous, dispersed body of literature capable of rendering all sorts of insights. At the limit, strategy formation is not just about values and vision, competences and capabilities, but also about the military and the Moonies, crisis and commitment, organizational learning and punctuated equilibrium, industrial organization and social revolution.<br><br>We consider this literature in its own terms. We do not, however, seek to <i>review</i> it comprehensively. (We had no more wish to write several thousand pages than most people have to read it.) This, in other words, is a <i>field</i> review, not a literature review. We seek to <i>cover</i> the literature and the practice -- to set out its different angles, orientations, tendencies. In so doing, we cite published work either because it has been key to a school or else because it well illustrates a body of work. We apologize to the many insightful writers and consultants whose work is not mentioned; we hope that we have left out no significant bodies of work.<br><br>We must add one point, however. There is a terrible bias in today's management literature toward the current, the latest, the "hottest." This does a disservice, not only to all those wonderful old writers, but especially to the readers who are all too frequently offered the trivial new instead of the significant old. We express no such bias in this book. Ours is a review of the evolution as well as the current state of this field. Later in this book we argue that ignorance of an organization's past can undermine the development of strategies for its future. The same is true for the field of strategic management. We ignore past work at our own peril. Indeed, we believe that time works on the literature and practice of strategic management much like it works on wine in barrels: it reveals what is excellent. We therefore apologize to no one for reminding the reader of so many wonderful old publications.<br><br><b>Five Ps for Strategy</b><br><br>The word <i>strategy</i> has been around for a long time. Managers now use it both freely and fondly. It is also considered to be the high point of managerial activity. For their part, academics have studied strategy extensively for about two decades now, while business schools usually have as their final required capstone a course in strategic management. The word <i>strategy</i> is so influential. But what does it really mean?<br><br>It is part of human nature to look for a definition for every concept. Most of the standard textbooks on strategy offer that definition, usually presented in the introductory chapter, more or less as follows: "top management's plans to attain outcomes consistent with the organization's missions and goals" (Wright et al.). No doubt such definitions have been dutifully memorized by generations of students, who have later used them in thousands of corporate reports. We offer no such easy definition here. Instead, we argue that strategy (not to mention ten such different schools about it) requires a number of definitions, five in particular (based on Mintzberg, 1987).<br><br>Ask someone to define strategy and you will likely be told that <i>strategy is a plan,</i> or something equivalent -- a direction, a guide or course of action into the future, a path to get from here to there. Then ask that person to describe the strategy that his or her own organization or that of a competitor <i>actually</i> pursued over the past five years -- not what they intended to do but what they really did. You will find that most people are perfectly happy to answer that question, oblivious to the fact that doing so differs from their very own definition of the term.<br><br>It turns out that strategy is one of those words that we inevitably define in one way yet often also use in another. <i>Strategy is a pattern,</i> that is, consistency in behavior over time. A company that perpetually markets the most expensive products in its industry pursues what is commonly called a high-end strategy, just as a person who always accepts the most challenging...</p><h2>Pathways to Successful Transition for Youth with Disabilities: A Developmental Process</h2><p><p>Bringing together the expertise of two of the most experienced scholars in transition personnel preparation this up-to-date text offers a balanced presentation of theory, research, and practice in regard to career guidance and transition for youth with disabilities. Its contemporary focus on such issues as inclusive education, cultural and linguistic diversity, and self-determination and advocacy creates a text with broad-based appeal; while its thorough scholarship supports content with a solid foundation in theory and research. The text is divided into three sections: Philosophical and Policy Foundations (Chapters 1-5), Implementation of Transition in Local Systems (Chapters 6-12), and Cultural Issues and Leadership for Transition (Chapters 13 &amp; 14), which can be used together or independently. It includes a unique, cross-categorical model emphasizing a wide variety of transition pathways; and, offers numerous practical suggestions for how to draft IEP transition language related to this model. The authors address many of the emerging issues and content areas not fully addressed in other transition texts, those being: The role of the general education teacher in middle and secondary general education classrooms and in community-based experiences; The crucial need for better educational and employment preparation systems to support youth with disabilities; &nbsp;The challenge educators face in developing educational programs that serve a diverse population of learners, including those with disabilities, at-risk for school failure, former school drop-outs, those with limited English proficiency, and teen parents; Sensitivity to and conceptual understanding of how cultural orientation affects attitudes toward work and careers; The need for transition professionals to clearly link self-determination concepts, career assessment, and individual transition planning; A deep understanding of the history of transition services, and the federal and state laws that provide authority and guidance to practice.

Covering not only Spanish but also Portuguese and French regions, and encompassing the latest research on the plantation system as well as on mining and the urban experience, the book brings together the recent findings on demography, the slave trade, the construction of the slave community and Afro-American culture. The book also sheds new light on the processes of accommodation and rebellion and the experience of emancipation. Klein first traces the evolution of slavery and forced labor systems in Europe, Africa, and America, and then depicts the life and culture which some twelve million slaves transported from Africa over five centuries experiences in the Latin American and Caribbean regions. Particular emphasis is on the evolution of the sugar plantation economy, the single largest user of African slave labor. The book examines attempts of the African and American-born slaves to create a viable and autonomous culture, including their adaptation of European languages, religions, and even kinship systems to their own needs. Klein also describes the type and intensity of slave rebellions. Finally the book considers the important and differing role of the &#34;free colored&#34; under slavery, noting the unique situation of the Brazilian free colored as well as the unusual mobility of the free colored in the French West Indies. The book concludes with a look at the post-emancipation integration patterns in the different societies, analyzing the relative success of the ex-slaves in obtaining control over land and escaping from the old plantation regimes.</p><p>Herbert S.

He reveals the secret settlements they built as they moved westward across the vast wilderness of North America, evading the European Church and Royal Houses. He explains how the Templars found refuge in the Sacred Medicine Lodges of the Algonquins, whose ceremonies and rituals bear striking resemblance to the initiations of Freemasonry. He reveals the strategic intermarriages that took place between the Natives and the Templars, furthering the Holy Bloodline and continuing the lineage of blood-guardians.

Highly recommended.&#34;--Library Journal.</p><p><i>On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts of the Kabbalah</i> is Gershom Scholem's introduction to the essential terms of Jewish mysticism. His chapter on Shekhinah--the kabbalist symbol of the female element of the godhead--helps explain why Kabbalah has a growing following among women. His chapter on Gilgul, or reincarnation, is fascinating for its description of how a spiritual phenomenon is formed, following the process from revelation to writing to teaching. And his final chapter on Tselem, or the astral body, will make you think twice about laughing at Shirley MacLaine. The astral body, according to Kabbalah, is the spiritual nature of each human being--the image of God described in Genesis 1. Scholem quotes pages of medieval rabbis' fantastic discoveries of their astral bodies, such as the following: <blockquote>When I wished to find knowledge of the secrets of Creation, I came upon a dark vault within the depths of the earth, filled with blowing winds.... Then there appeared to me in my sleep a shape of most wondrous beauty [giving me instructions on how to conduct myself in order to attain knowledge of the highest things]. I then said to him: "Who are you?" And he answered: "I am your perfected nature."</blockquote> <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Gershom Scholem was a professor of Jewish mysticism at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem until his death in 1982. Among his most important works are <i>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, The Messianic Idea in Judaism,</i> and <i>On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism.</i></p><h2>The Storm</h2><p><p>The <em>Boston Globe</em> calls Frederick Buechner "one of our finest writers." <em>USA Today</em> says he's "one of our most original storytellers." Now this acclaimed author gives us his most beguiling novel yet--a magical tale of love, betrayal, and redemption inspired by Shakespeare's <em>The Tempest</em>.</p><p>On wealthy Plantation Island in South Florida, an old man waits, Kenzie Maxwell is a writer, a raconteur, a rascal, an altruist, a mystic--a charismatic figure who enjoys life with his rich third wife but muses daily on the sins of his past. Two decades ago, Kenzie had to leave New York because of a scandal. He'd been a volunteer at a runawat shelter, and he'd fallen in love with a seventeen-year-old girl--a girl who died while giving birth to Kenzie's daughter. His older brother, Dalton, a lawyer and board member at the shelter, decided to quell the rumors by releasing Kenzie's note of apology to the press. Kenzie's reputation--and the girl's--were destroyed. He has never forgiven his brother.</p><p>Now it's the eve of Kenzie's seventieth birthday, and a storm is brewing. His beloved daughter, Bree--the child of the scandal--is coming down from New York for his birthday party. But his brother Dalton is coming down, too, to do some legal work for the island's ill-tempered matriarch. Aided and abetted by Dalton's happy-go-lucky stepson, a loutish gardener, a New Age windsurfer, a bumbling bishop, and a bona fide tempest, Kenzie must somehow contrive to reconcile with his brother--and make peace with his past.</p><p>Infused with humanity, and informed by faith. <em>The Storm</em> is Frederick Buechner's most captivating novel since <em>Godric</em>--a richly satisfying contemporary story of fragmented families and love's many mysteries that will move you, makeyou laugh, and fill you with wonder.</p></p><p>An island. A storm. A shipwreck. An exiled old man with a beautiful daughter--sound familiar? If <i>The Tempest</i> comes to mind, you're close. Frederick Buechner bases his novel <i>The Storm</i> on Shakespeare's melancholy last play, but adds some distinctly 20th-century twists of his own. The protagonist of this tall tale is Kenzie Maxwell, an elderly writer living off his third wife's money on an island in South Florida. Kenzie's 70th birthday is coming up, and his family starts to gather: his illegitimate daughter, Bree, comes from New York; and so does his estranged brother, Dalton--the man responsible for his leaving New York in disgrace many years before. Also along for the ride is Dalton's appealing young stepson, Nandy; Kenzie's mystical wind-surfer pal, Averill; and Calvert, the boorish gardener. Readers familiar with the play will instantly recognize who's who in this gallery of characters. Though the party gets off to a rocky start and a tempest is brewing just off shore, by the time Buechner finishes working his own rough magic, <i>The Storm</i> becomes a harbinger not of disaster but of reconciliation and love. <i>--Margaret Prior</i><p>Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister. He has been a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and was honored by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His most recent work is <em>Beyond Words: Daily Readings in the ABC&#x2019;s of Faith</em>.</p></p><h2>Family Treatment: Evidence-Based Practice with Populations at Risk</h2><p>Now featuring the work of two new co-authors (Catheleen Jordan and Cynthia Franklin) and emphasizing the field&#39;s current focus on evidence-based approaches in family treatment, this text gives students an understanding of the relationship between individual and family functioning and problem solving.

When I read the preface and the "how to use the book" it was very easy to navigate the chapters. These chapters are logical and the foundation chapters (one through seven in my opinion) define assessment features that are often overlooked-- nutrition and social/spiritual health. There are PLENTY of varieties in the normal and abnormal photos so that if a student did not have the clinical opportunity to see these features as a student one would want to keep the text for reference as a practitioner.I am impressed by the scope and the number of these learning tools and the placement in text. It is my experience that different students learn in different modalities -- many will want the nursing tips approach while others need to dream and learn with the life at 360 degrees.Students will use the cardborad " Assessement in Brief" while reviewing chapters as a bookmark. Greeat inclusion -I am impressed by the scope of authors cited as contributors and the similar approach in writing style. This text reads well as a unit without logical lapses in flow. Top three strengths: 1.lavish illustrations well labelled and near relevant text 2.case studies span the lifespan and include health determinants (culture, social support, income, education) 3. substantive references at each chapter end encourage the learner and the educator to learn more and stay current with evidence based practice. (bibliography, web sites, and references) Overall, this text as written has utility for the diploma, degree, and advanced practice nurse who is interetsed in health assessment theory and skill development. The depth of the health history sections in each chapter of section three is consistently easy to follow and comprehensive. "<br><br>"Three strengths are new approach with extra boxes, photos are excellent, use of cards in back of book, inclusion of case studies."</p><h2>West of Everything: The Inner Life of Westerns (Oxford Paperbacks)</h2><p>A leading figure in the debate over the literary canon, Jane Tompkins was one of the first to point to the ongoing relevance of popular women's fiction in the 19th century, long overlooked or scorned by literary critics. Now, in <em>West of Everything</em>, Tompkins shows how popular novels and films of the American west have shaped the emotional lives of people in our time.<br> Into this world full of violence and manly courage, the world of John Wayne and Louis L'Amour, Tompkins takes her readers, letting them feel what the hero feels, endure what he endures. Writing with sympathy, insight, and respect, she probes the main elements of the Western--its preoccupation with death, its barren landscapes, galloping horses, hard-bitten men and marginalized women--revealing the view of reality and code of behavior these features contain. She considers the Western hero's attraction to pain, his fear of women and language, his desire to dominate the environment--and to merge with it. In fact, Tompkins argues, for better or worse Westerns have taught us all--men especially--how to behave.<br> It was as a reaction against popular women's novels and women's invasion of the public sphere that Westerns originated, Tompkins maintains. With Westerns, men were reclaiming cultural territory, countering the inwardness, spirituality, and domesticity of the sentimental writers, with a rough and tumble, secular, man-centered world. Tompkins brings these insights to bear in considering film classics such as <em>Red River</em> and <em>Lonely Are the Brave</em>, and novels such as Louis L'Amour's <em>Last of the Breed</em> and Owen Wister's <em>The Virginian</em>. In one of the most moving chapters (chosen for <em>Best American</em> <em>Essays of 1991</em>), Tompkins shows how the life of Buffalo Bill Cody, killer of Native Americans and charismatic star of the Wild West show, evokes the contradictory feelings which the Western typically elicits--horror and fascination with violence, but also love and respect for the romantic ideal of the cowboy.<br> Whether interpreting a photograph of John Wayne of meditating on the slaughter of cattle, Jane Tompkins writes with humor, compassion, and a provocative intellect. Her book will appeal to many Americans who read or watch Westerns, and to all those interested in a serious approach to popular culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jane Tompkins</strong> is Professor of English at Duke University. She is author of <em>Sensational Designs</em> and the editor of <em>Reader Response Criticism</em>.<br>"The feminist perspective of West of Everything makes it invaluable to the ongoing critical discourse on Westerns."--The San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"Jane Tompkins knows her Western through and through; she handles details, events and scenes from novels and movies with skill and surety....She brings spirit, energy, freshness and originality to a field of study that has long been buried many feet deep in cliches."--Patricia Nelson Limerick,<br>The Boston Sunday Globe<br><br>"A passionate and generous book."--Newsday<br><br>"Interesting and thought-provoking."--Library Journal<br><br>"In explaining how she overcame her prejudices against the Western Tompkins illuminates the genre as few others ever have."--Hubert I. Cohen, University of Michigan<br><br>"A daring and confrontational literary essay meant to rattle the peace of mind of just about every cowboy on the face of the earth....Throughout her book [Tompkins] evidences a charm, honesty, and sense of intellectual adventure that would make her a happy pardner on a long ride....And why do<br>I love Miz Tompkins so much for bush-whacking the myth of the West inside me? Because she's right."--John Calvin Batchelor, Washington Post Book World<br><br>"Anyone who cares about American popular culture could profit from reading this masterpiece."--Booklist<br><br>"We've long recognized that the western is a basic myth of masculinity. Thus, it's not surprising that a woman scholar might have, if not the last word, at least a good deal to say about the genre. What's even more striking is that Jane Tompkins in West of Everything not only develops an<br>insightful feminist critique of the western as macho mythos, but also has some brilliant observations to make about the genre's compelling artistic and cultural force. This is not simply gender criticism, but cultural and aesthetic analysis at its most fascinating."--John G. Cawelti, University of<br>Kentucky<br><br>"Treating both Western novels and Western movies, Jane Tompkins argues that there is nothing trivial about the desires they arouse or the violence they persuade us to applaud. By the end of her study, she forces us to confront that righteous ecstasy through which, for one brief moment, we all<br>share in the murderous discharge of tension which traditionally concludes the Western. It is a chilling and provocative Epilogue to a book that movingly demonstrates why this famous feminist critic has always found herself both attracted to and repelled by the power of cowboy heroes. In short, a<br>bracing and sobering analysis."--Annette Kolodny, author of The Lay of the Land and The Land Before Her<br><br>"[A] captivating, witty study....A great read.

For many years, it was customary to divide Taoism into &#34;philosophical Taoism&#34; and &#34;religious Taoism.&#34; The author has long argued that this is a false division and that &#34;religious&#34; Taoism is simply the practice of &#34;philosophical&#34; Taoism. She sees Taoism as foremost a religion, and the present work traces the development of Taoism up to the point it reached its mature form (which remains intact today, albeit with modern innovations). The main aim of this history of Taoism is to trace the major lines of its doctrinal evolution, showing the coherence of its development, the wide varieties of factors that came into play over a long period of disconnected eras, the constant absorptions of outside contributions, and the progress that integrates them. The author shows how certain recurrent themes are treated in different ways in different eras and different sects. Among these themes are the Ultimate Truth, immortality, the Sage, the genesis and the end of the world, retribution for good and evil acts, representations of heavens and hells, and the connections between life and the spirit, between life and death, between man and society, and between mystical experience and the social form of religion. The plan of the book is chronological, but the chronology is somewhat fluid given the way Taoism evolved; as it assimilated new features in the course of its growth, it never ceased to continue to develop the old ones. Thus the Celestial Masters sect, which is chronologically the first to attain a structure, is treated at the outset of the book though it exists down to our day, and the Shangqing tradition took shape in the fourth century though its glory years were under the Tang (618-907).</p><p>&#x201c;This is a work of monumental importance by arguably the foremost scholar of Taoism in the world. Insights from the study of Taoism are profoundly changing the way we view China's past, and this book fills the need for a comprehensive history that reflects the progress made in Taoist studies over the last few decades. Though Taoism is known to be an abstruse religion, Robinet lays bare its 'bones and sinews' in exceptionally clear language, one of the things that makes the book so valuable for classroom use.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Stephen Bokenkamp,<br>Indiana UniversityIsabelle Robinet is Professor of Chinese at the University of Aix-en-Provence.</p><h2>Roach&#39;s Introductory Clinical Pharmacology+Lippincott&#39;s Photo Atlas of Medication Administration</h2><p><br>Prepare for your future career and success on the NCLEX with the only pharmacology textbook truly written for the LPN/LVN student,<b>Roach&#x2019;s Introductory Clinical Pharmacology</b>.

His writing articulated the intent of the New York school &#x2015;Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Adolph Gottlieb, Franz Kline, Arshile Gorky, and others&#x2015;during a period when their work was often reviled for its departure from traditional representation. As founder of the Documents of Modern Art series (later renamed the Documents of Twentieth-Century Art), Motherwell gave modern artists a voice at a time when very few people understood their theories or work. This authoritative new edition of the artist's writings about art includes public lectures, essays, and interviews. Impeccably edited, with an informative introductory essay and rigorous annotation, it is illustrated with black-and-white images that elucidate Motherwell's writings.</p><p>"Robert Motherwell was not just a great painter, he was a brilliant thinker. As the founding editor of <i>The Documents of Twentieth-Century of Art</i>, he decisively shaped our understanding of modernism.

But, cutting through to the essential questions that generated the movement, the writings of Robert Motherwell are a treasure. Written at the same time he was painting, Motherwell's texts make me feel like a witness to the philosophical curiosity that generated one of the most powerful art movements of the twentieth century."&#x2015;Michael Auping, author of <i>Abstract Expressionism: The Critical Developments</i><br><br>&#x201c;This book is essential reading for anyone thinking about the uneasy clash of modernism and postmodernism in postwar America; Motherwell&#x2019;s writing played a decisive role and this volume is an admirably full account of it.&#x201d;&#x2015;Jonathan Fineberg, author of <i>When We Were Young: New Perspectives on the Art of the Child</i><b>Dore Ashton </b>is Professor of Art History at the Cooper Union and author or editor of over 30 books on modern art and culture, including <i>Noguchi East and West, The New York School: A Cultural Reckoning, A Fable of Modern Art, </i>and <i>A Critical Study of Philip Guston, </i>all from UC Press. <b>Joan Banach </b>worked with Robert Motherwell from 1981 to 1991.

Clinicians, researchers, and managed care administrators will have at their fingertips expert assessment of over 275 measures in a wide array of domains, including a review of each measure's clinical utility, goals, practical issues, and psychometric properties. Use of this special resource is further enhanced by a CD-ROM containing the full text of 150 of these measures--an invaluable aid for reference and clinical decision-making.<br> <br> In this fully revised edition, more than 40 measures have been added to the discussion and to the CD-ROM. In addition to reassessing measures for inclusion--adding measures that empirically provide better patient evaluation and subtracting measures that have been superseded--chapter authors have thoroughly examined and revised measure discussions to provide the most relevant and timely information for clinicians. Costs, translations, and contact information for each measure have also been updated.<br> <br> Introductory chapters provide background on the application of measures in specific contexts, including a discussion of cultural factors, psychometric properties, and the clinical selection of measures. Readers are then fully equipped with extensive coverage of general diagnostic measures for adults, and measures to evaluate psychiatric symptoms, mental and physical health status, quality of life, adverse effects, patient perceptions of care, stress and life events, family and relational issues, and suicide risk. Next, 17 disorder-specific chapters impart expert review of measures for disorders of childhood and adolescence, cognitive disorders, substance use, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, psychotic disorders, dissociative disorders, personality disorders, impulse-control, sexual dysfunction, eating disorders, sleep disorders, and aggression. Each chapter includes updated measure descriptions, new measure variants and research, and newly selected measures particularly appropriate to the domain of discussion.<br> <br> The <i>Handbook of Psychiatric Measures,</i> Second Edition, promises to become one of the most-used and highly valued resources at a clinician's, researcher's, and administrator's disposal. Much more than a summary of measures, this revised edition provides <i>the</i> essential information to make better decisions about the use of a particular measure.</p><p><b>A.

In this probing analysis of U.S. military policy in Vietnam, career army officer and strategist Andrew F. Krepinevich, Jr., argues that precisely because of this mindset the war was lost before it was fought.</p><p>The army assumed that it could transplant to Indochina the operational methods that had been successful in the European battle theaters of World War II, an approach that proved ill-suited to the way the Vietnamese Communist forces fought. Theirs was a war of insurgency, and counterinsurgency, Krepinevich contends, requires light infantry formations, firepower restraint, and the resolution of political and social problems within the nation. To the very end, top military commanders refused to recognize this.</p><p>Krepinevich documents the deep division not only between the American military and civilian leaders over the very nature of the war, but also within the U.S. Army itself. Through extensive research in declassified material and interviews with officers and men with battlefield experience, he shows that those engaged in the combat understood early on that they were involved in a different kind of conflict. Their reports and urgings were discounted by the generals, who pressed on with a conventional war that brought devastation but little success.</p><p>A thorough analysis of the U.S. Army&#x2019;s role in the Vietnam War, this book demonstrates with chilling persuasiveness the ways in which the army was unprepared to fight&#x2015;lessons applicable to today&#x2019;s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p></p><p>The Army And Vietnam examines the folly of the U.S. attempt to transplant to Indochina the operational methods of conventional warfare that had been successful in the European battle theaters of World War II.

(Studies in Curriculum Theory Series)</h2><p><p>This primer for teachers (prospective and practicing) asks readers to question the historical present and their relation to it, and in so doing, to construct their own understandings of what it means to teach, to study, to become "educated" in the present moment. </p> <p>Curriculum theory is the scholarly effort &#x2013; inspired by theory in the humanities, arts and interpretive social sciences &#x2013; to understand the curriculum, defined here as "complicated conversation." Rather than the formulation of objectives to be evaluated by (especially standardized) tests, curriculum is communication informed by academic knowledge, and it is characterized by educational experience.

James provides an introduction to one of the greatest mystery novels in English literature, Wilkie Collins's <em>The Moonstone</em>.</p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.The elements which make up The Moonstone- a purloined Indian jewel which carries with it a mysterious curse, a stolid British police sergeant, a drama of theft and murder in a spacious country home- have been repeated, in slightly varying guises, throughout much of the detective fiction that Wilkie Collins&#39; immensely popular 1868 novel gave birth to.</p><h2>Building a House for Diversity: A Fable About a Giraffe &amp; an Elephant Offers New Strategies for Today's Workforce</h2><p>A giraffe and an elephant consider themselves friends. But when the giraffe invites the elephant into his home, disaster strikes. The house has been designed to meet the needs of the tall, slender giraffe. The elephant smashes into doorways and walls trying to maneuver. The giraffe gently suggests aerobics and ballet classes. The elephant is unconvinced. To him, the house is the problem...<br>R. Roosevelt Thomas, one of America's most respected experts on diversity, uses the metaphor of giraffes and elephants - insiders and outsiders - to examine our assumptions about power, influence, affirmative action, and acceptance of "the others." His richly accessible guide will have you thinking about these critical issues in a whole new way. And it will show you how to develop the quantifiable set of skills that are the essence of diversity management.~</p><p><p> "What could an elephant and a giraffe teach people about working together? Some very important lessons, it seems, about the complex--and critically important--issues of dealing with diversity in the workforce. </p> <p> </p> <p> Building a House for Diversity begins with a short fable about how a friendship between the two animals is threatened when the house built for a tall, skinny giraffe cannot accommodate his invited guest, a broad, bulky elephant. Using this story as a vivid metaphor for the difficult issues inherent in diversity, the book goes on to demonstrate how managing diversity can be seen as a set of skills that anyone can learn and use. </p> <p> </p> <p> In a way that makes diversity management ""up close and personal,"" Building a House for Diversity offers compelling, real-life stories of individual experiences at work. It includes: </p> <p> </p> <p> * The perspective of both ""insiders"" (usually white males) and ""outsiders"" (usually minorities or women) </p> <p> * Insightful commentary illuminating what these experiences tell us about the challenges and opportunities of diversity </p> <p> * A particularly interesting segment on Phil Jackson, legendary Chicago Bulls coach, and how he dealt with diversity issues in his relationships to Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippin, and others </p> <p> * Hands-on guidance to help readers become ""diversity mature"" and take personal responsibility for their attitudes and actions. </p> <p> </p> <p> Throughout, the book reflects the seminal thinking of R.

We read and read, trying to understand why we had to die in our early twenties. We felt the clock ticking away towards our death, every sound of the clock shortening our lives.&#x201d; So wrote Irokawa Daikichi, one of the many kamikaze pilots, or <i>tokkotai</i>, who faced almost certain death in the futile military operations conducted by Japan at the end of World War II.&nbsp;<br><br>This moving history presents diaries and correspondence left by members of the <i>tokkotai </i>and other Japanese student soldiers who perished during the war. Outside of Japan, these kamikaze pilots were considered unbridled fanatics and chauvinists who willingly sacrificed their lives for the emperor. But the writings explored here by Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney clearly and eloquently speak otherwise. A significant number of the kamikaze were university students who were drafted and forced to volunteer for this desperate military operation. Such young men were the intellectual elite of modern Japan: steeped in the classics and major works of philosophy, they took Descartes&#x2019; &#x201c;I think, therefore I am&#x201d; as their motto. And in their diaries and correspondence, as Ohnuki-Tierney shows, these student soldiers wrote long and often heartbreaking soliloquies in which they poured out their anguish and fear, expressed profound ambivalence toward the war, and articulated thoughtful opposition to their nation&#x2019;s imperialism.&nbsp;<br><br>A salutary correction to the many caricatures of the kamikaze, this poignant work will be essential to anyone interested in the history of Japan and World War II.</p><p><b>Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney</b> is the William F. Vilas Research Professor of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison. She is the author of numerous books, including <i>Kamikaze, Cherry Blossoms, and Nationalisms: The Militarization of Aesthetics in Japanese History</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press."The poems, letters and diaries featured in this book give the lie to the notion that Japan was unified behind the war. The voices of the student soldiers speak thoughtfully and eloquently about their dilemma between duty to the nation and wanting to stay alive. . . . A timely and necessary correction of a popular myth, and an important contribution to an understanding of Japan at war." (<i>Economist</i>)<br><br>"Ohnuki-Tierney provides a valuable service in delving beyond the stereotype into the minds of these frightened, thoughtful students." (David Pilling <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>"With the June publication of [<i>Kamikaze Diaries</i>] . . . and the premiere of&nbsp; Clint Eastwood's film "Letters from Iwo Jima," the image of Japanese soldiers created in the milieu of World War II propaganda will receive a long overdue makeover." (Alison Brady <i>Japan Times</i>)<br><br>"The diaries . . . are gripping in their emotional impact and provide us with extensive insights into the lives of these tragic young men." (F.G. Notehelfer <i>International History Review</i>)<br><br>"Ohnuki-Tierney's work presents a deeper exposition than hitherto available in English of <i>tokkotai</i> pilots' personal backgrounds and humanizes their struggles. The Anglophone reading audience is richer for her contribution. . . . Read in tandem, the first book offers historical analysis, while the second provides a thorough . . . annotated and translateed insight into what the student pilots read." (Barak Kushner <i>Monumenta Nipponica</i>)<br><br>"[The book] is a tremendous contribution to gaining a deeper understanding of the human legacy imbued with the kamikazes. Well-written, the narrative is difficult, for the reader understands that these student soldiers' lives of great promise all ended prematurely." (Peter Clemens <i>Journal of Military History</i>)<br><br>"The diaries are fascinating as the scant, sometimes eloquent, painfully inadequate trail left behind by self-aware young men in the pressurized months before their certain doom. . . . The study has useful things to tell us about our recent history. It brings into tantalizing view some unexdpected questions about the uses and limitations of humane education, and turns a raw light on the sinister powers of militarism that continue to threaten all of us."

When the school moved to Dessau, Moholy-Nagy and Walter Gropius began a fruitful collaboration as joint publishers of the <i>Bauhausb�cher</i> series. <br><br>In addition to designing and editing the <i>Bauhausb�cher</i>, Moholy-Nagy produced a title of his own: the legendary <i>Painting, Photography, Film</i>. In this book, Moholy-Nagy&#x2019;s efforts to have photography and filmmaking recognized as art forms on the same level as painting are propounded and explained at length. The artist makes the case for a radical rethinking of the visual arts and the further development of photographic design to keep pace with a radically changing technological modernity. <br><br>Alongside theoretical and technical approaches and forays into the nature of the medium, Moholy-Nagy uses an extensive appendix of illustrations to provide a thorough survey of the numerous possibilities that photography and film could offer&#x2015;from press photography and scientific imagery to Moholy-Nagy&#x2019;s own abstract photograms and New Vision photographs. <br><br>This English translation of <i>Painting, Photography, Film</i> is based in content and design on the 1925 German first edition, making the latter available to an international readership for the first time. The publication includes a brief scholarly text providing crucial contextual information and reflecting on the history and legacy of Moholy-Nagy&#x2019;s book.</p></p><p></p><h2>Transmission of Light: Zen in the Art of Enlightenment by Zen Master Keizan</h2><p>A translation of the classic <i>Denkoroku</i> by one of the premier translators of Buddhist and Taoist texts illustrates how to arrive at the epiphanic Zen awakening known as <i>satori.</i> <br><br>The essential initiatory experience of Zen, satori is believed to open up the direct perception of things as they are. "Even if you sit until your seat breaks through, even if you persevere mindless of fatigue, even if you are a person of lofty deeds and pure behavior, if you haven't reached this realm of satori, you still can't get out of the prison of the world." Deliberately cultivated and employed to awaken the dormant potency of the mind, satori is said to be accessible to all people, transcending time, history, culture, race, gender, and personality. <br><br>Attributed to the thirteenth-century Zen Master Keizan (1268&#x2013;1325), <i>Transmission of Light </i> (along with <i>The Blue Cliff Record </i> and <i>The Gateless Barrier </i>)<i> </i>is one of three essential koan texts used by Zen students. Techniques for reaching the enlightening experience of satori are revealed through fifty-three short tales about the awakenings of successive generations of masters, beginning with the twelfth-century Zen master Ejo, dharma heir to Dogen. <br><br>The translator's introduction establishes the context for <i>Transmission of Light </i> within the Zen canon and elucidates central themes of the work, including the essential idea that genuine satori "is not the end of Zen; it is more properly the true beginning."</p><p>Thomas Cleary holds a PhD in East Asian Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University and a JD from the University of California, Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law.

Philosophy)</h2><p>Abandon the notion of subject-matter as something fixed and ready-made in itself, outside the child&#x2019;s experience; cease thinking of the child&#x2019;s experience as also something hard and fast; see it as something fluent, embryonic, vital; and we realize that the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process. &#x2015;from The Child and the Curriculum In this single volume, readers will find two of John Dewey&#x2019;s insightful essays on education in America. He considered proper education to be fundamental to a functioning democracy. The problem, according to Dewey in The School and Society, with the old education model was that elementary schools did not encourage exploration and curiosity in their students. In The Child and the Curriculum, Dewey expands upon his definition of the ideal teaching method. A child&#x2019;s life, he says, is an integrated whole. A child will flow from one topic to another, taking a natural interest in subjects and dealing with a world of direct experience. School, on the other hand, addresses a world disconnected from a child&#x2019;s life. A more reasonable approach would be to strive to integrate their experience with the vast body of knowledge that society wishes them to know. By honoring the individual, both the student and the subject matter will come together in a process that produces a mature adult. American educator and philosopher JOHN DEWEY (1859&#x2013;1952) helped found the American Association of University Professors. He served as professor of philosophy at Columbia University from 1904 to 1930 and authored numerous books, including How We Think (1910), Experience and Nature (1925), Experience and Education (1938), and Freedom and Culture (1939).</p><p></p><h2>Moulin Rouge!: The Splendid Book That Charts the Journey of Baz Luhrmann&#39;s Motion Picture (Newmarket Pictorial Moviebooks)</h2><p>Provides a behind-the-scenes look at the film about a penniless poet who falls in love with the star of the Moulin Rouge club.</p><p>The acclaimed director of Romeo and Juliet, which grossed $140 million worldwide, and Strictly Ballroom, which grossed over $80 million.

Cinematic and plot highlights, behind-the-scenes shots and confessions by producers, choreographers, cinematographers, editors, etc., along with images by guest photographers Ellen Von Unwerth, Mary Ellen Mark and Douglas Kirkland, give fans a chance to luxuriate in the stunning visual array that whirls dizzyingly by in the film. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>A Peacock on the Roof</h2><p>Prince the peacock creates an awkward predicament for his owner when he flies away and lands on the roof of a strange house, whose occupants do not know he is there.</p><p>- Develops vocabulary as possible new words are introduced (e.g. vain, peahen, launched, wellingtons, rumpus, etc.)<br> - Introduces child to literature using chapters.<br> - Uses colour, double-page spreads - beautiful illustrations.<br> - Emphasizes visual images.<br> - Illustrations blend with the text to add interest.<br> - Projects human traits onto animal characters.<br> - Promotes discussion on care of animals and birds.<br> - Encourages use of visual motor and observational skills as child and parent try to find <p>hidden storyteller on each page.<br> - Engages the child in emergent reading behavior as the child "re-reads" the story alone using the illustrations to re-tell the story in their own language.<br> - Utilizes a very attractive format which directly relates to the text.</p>When asked to write a brief autobiographical account of how I came to be so interested in art, music and wildlife, I found myself faced with a problem. Most people would be able to list their achievements or qualifications, and mention how and where they had trained. I can no none of this, having no training or qualifications at all. On reflection, it seems that various circumstances and events during my childhood have shaped my life. <p>When I was young, my father would tell me a different story every night, improvised on any subject I chose. Perhaps this has led to my own fondness of telling stories. So here is another story - not an imaginary story this time, but a true one... </p><p>One of my earliest childhood memories is of being ill in bed with the measles. To keep me amused, my mother would sit on the bed and draw pictures for me to colour. I can still recall the picture on one particular day. A weasell sat on a log, surrounded by mounts of autumn leaves and conkers. Proud of the finished result, mother asked if there was anything else I would like as a special present to cheer me up. Without a moments hesitation, I replied, "A tortoise". </p><p>Although the request was not quite what she had expected, my very first pet arrived later that afternoon and was given the name of Fred! I remember being fascinated by his every movement, especially his trick of being able to withdraw into his shell. He was later joined by a rabbit, and the three of us would go on picnics together. They were happy, carefree days, but they came to a sudden end when it was time to start school. </p><p>Up till that time I had spent very little time with other children; always preferring my own company and that of various little creature I adopted. Only a few days after starting school, something happened that has probably affected me ever since. During my walk home, which took me down a long, narrow lane, an older schoolboy chased after me brandishing a knife, shouting that he was going to kill me. Even now I can hear the pounding of his footsteps behind me as I raced towards home. I had no desire to ever return to school again, but of course I had no choice. In an attempt to rectify matters, the headmaster paraded me through every classroom until I found the culprit. But instead of solving the problem, this only served to isolate me further from all the other children. From hen on I was a marked person, often I would arrive in the morning to find my books torn and my desk upside-down. Just like the tortoise, I began to withdraw into my shell. More and more I came to appreciate any time I could spend alone. </p><p>At six and a half years old, I acquired my first pair of walking boots. They had animal footprints on the soles, and each one had a tiny pocket in the heel to hide a sixpense, in case of emergency. So, suitably shod, with my precious binoculars around my neck, and sketchpad and pencil in my pocket, I would spend many happy hours on nature rambles with my Uncle and Aunt.<br> I remember walking to "secret places" in the wood to feed the squirrels. I had a pocket full of peanuts, and the long tailed tits, nuthatches and chaffinches would fly down to my hand to take them. </p><p>Another day in the forest we fed all our sandwiches to a herd of fallow deer. Then later we were so hungry we ate the wild black cherries growing along the lane. </p><p>Returning home I would spend hours making detailed drawings of the creature s I had seen. More often than not, 'dressing them up' in imaginary outfits of clothing. More an more I would daydream in a fantasy world of little creatures to escape the reality of an unhappy school life. </p><p>From early on I had earned the nickname 'Birdboy', because of being more familiar with the names of feathered friends than my so-called school friends. My school report that year proved true indeed. It said 'Paul's artwork is very promising, but he finds it difficult to make friends."<br> As I grew older, my collection of pets gradually increased. Several rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, gerbils, a budgerigar, and a duck, along with any orphaned or injured wild birds I happened to find.<br> About this time, I began to take an interest in music, and started piano lessons. I took to it immediately, and a few months after beginning to learn, I composed my first piece of music 'Waltz in F'. </p><p>It was very interesting for me to find something that could give me so much pleasure. My mind became filled with music, and nothing satisfied me more than the composition of a new etude or nocturn. Every single afternoon I would rush home from school, and sit straight down at the piano not even pausing to remove my coat. Then without stopping I would play for an hour or more until all thoughts of school had left me and I felt relaxed once more. </p><p>The following five years in senior school were no happier. I lived for the time when I would be able to leave. Finally I opted to leave six months early, taking only my final exams in Art an English. Although I took both of these exams my papers were somehow lost. I always thought that I was a ploy to force me to stay on at school longer, but my mind was made up. I left school without any regrets, but also without any qualifications what so ever. </p><p>My first job was in a gift shop. This gradually got me used to being with other people and began to undo some of the ill effects of years earlier. My bird collection increased further with the addition of several pairs of ducks, some rare breeds of poultry, peacocks and my most loyal companion of all - Toby, a yorkshire terrier. His delightful personality and gentleness with all the other creatures inspired me to begin writing short stories and verses to accompany the pictures I still painted of them all. </p><p>So a few years later when the shop closed down, I decided not to seek reemployment immediately, but to take writing and illustrating more seriously and seek publication.<br> But that is quite another story..........</p></p><h2>The Psychological and Social Impact of Illness and Disability</h2><p><p>This edition...adds an important international perspective on illness and disability.

Yet a few basic types will satisfy a diverse clientele. Other foods may attract different birds.<br> &nbsp;<br> � Sunflower seeds: These come in two kinds. The smaller black-oil sunflower seeds will bring the greatest variety of species, from chickadees and titmice to jays. The larger striped type is better for strong-billed birds such as Purple Finches and Evening Grosbeaks. Even woodpeckers will visit a hopper or tray feeder for sunflower seeds.<br> &nbsp;<br> � Mixed seeds: A birdseed mix should be an important part of any backyard menu, but quality varies greatly. The best mixtures are combinations of black-oil sunflower, white proso millet, bits of nuts and corn, and perhaps safflower as well. Avoid the least expensive mixtures, which are filled with the small globes of red milo, which very few birds except doves eat.<br> &nbsp;<br> � Nuts and corn: Almost all seed-eating birds will enjoy unsalted nuts broken into bits with a rolling pin, and larger birds including jays will like cracked corn (although rake it up if it gets wet). Scatter the nuts and corn on the ground and hope that the birds will get their fair share before the squirrels arrive for breakfast.<br> &nbsp;<br> � Suet and peanut butter: These are high-energy winter foods loved by many species. See page 23 for tips on how to provide them. Suet is favored especially by woodpeckers. Peanut butter is a source of crucial energy for birds in winter, and it can be lifesaving for Carolina Wrens at the northern end of their range in a harsh season.<br> &nbsp;<br> � Fruits: Oranges cut in half or apples and other fruits cut in pieces are favorites of orioles, especially when they return in the spring to breed. Berries are a favored winter food for thrushes, Cedar Waxwings, and Yellow-rumped Warblers, but these are best provided by landscaping with shrubs that will be loaded with berries during fall and winter.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;� Specialties: Experiment with other types of foods such as mealworms, which parents feed to nestlings; crushed oyster shell, a source of calcium; or stone grit, which various birds require to crush foods in their gizzard. Avoid using old bread.<br> &nbsp;<br> � Hummingbird food: Nothing beats the classic, simple recipe of one part white granulated sugar to four parts water. Boil the water, then add the sugar and stir. Don&#x2019;t use food coloring or artificial sweetener.</p><h2>Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess</h2><p>This book is essentially a teaching machine. The way a teaching machine works is: It asks you a question. If you give the right answer, it goes on to the next question. If you give the wrong answer, it tells you why the answer is wrong and tells you to go back and try again. This is called &#34;programmed learning&#34;. The real authors were experts and authorities in the field of programmed learning. Bobby Fischer lent his name to the project. Stuart Margulies is a chess master and also a recognized authority on programmed learning.

The harsh endurance test of survival at sea, magnified by the dying sailor's condition, sends the crewmen through an emotional gamut, ranging from pity and selfless compassion to fear, resentment, and a profound hatred that boils perilously close to mutiny.<br>In this 1897 novel, a compelling examination of human character under conditions of extreme danger and stress, Joseph Conrad considers some of his customary preoccupations. His masterful narrative technique captures every nuance of atmospheric tension as it explores issues related to moral dilemmas, isolation, and the psychology of inner compulsions. Conrad drew upon his two decades of experience in the British merchant marine for the vital, memorable characterizations and realistic depictions of seafaring life in this and many of his other works.<br></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price.

But is is also Conrad&#39;s first major exploration of the psychology of service-of the pressure on a group of seamen &#39;brought to the test...of the moral problems of conduct&#39; by their encounter with elemental nature and with the secret terrors and evasions of two of their comrades.</p><h2>The Saintmakers</h2><p>The Saint Makers is a thorough exploration of the contemporary evolution of religious folk art, or santo making, in the American Southwest.</p><p></p><h2>A Book of the Book: Some Works and Projections about the Book &amp; Writing</h2><p>"A collection for the general reader and the specialist, <i>A Book of the Book</i> is an accessible and erudite set of readings on the book as a mythic and material object. These texts comprise a vivid exploration of the poetics of the book, a multifaceted study nurtured by the literary and ethnographic scope of its editors' vision, that argues compellingly for the continued survival of this most mundane and metaphoric of artifacts. In a moment when irresponsibly inflammatory ravings about the demise of print rage through the cultural landscape, this collection offers serious reflection upon the real profundity of the book as a symbolic force within the poetic and spiritual imagination that remains the wellspring of human culture.

It was in its aftermath that we felt the appeal of expanding the work both in size and range and in the recognition that the physicality of the book was a necessary concomitant to Mallarm�&#x2019;s proposition of the spiritual book that we were still eager to further explore. And we were aware too that the hegemony of the material book&#x2014;as a conglomerate of cloth and paper and ink and leather and glue and thread&#x2014;was in some danger of being superceded by that of the virtual non-book&#x2014;much as the book and writing had challenged the dominance of the oral technologies that came before them. It is those key terms&#x2014;oral, material, virtual, spiritual&#x2014;that underlie the discussions in the pages that follow. Set in the context of a turning from one century into another&#x2014;indeed of one millennium into another&#x2014;they encompass the full range of human languages t! hat makes an ethnopoetics the underpinning for any still viable poetics. </p><p>A more substantial pre-face from the editors&#x2019; perspective heads off the �rst section of this gathering&#x2014;a section in which we extend the privilege of prefacing to a number of other interested parties. We do this as a way to move beyond our limits and to recognize some of those who have thought long and hard about the practice and problematics of the book and writing. In much the same way we&#x2019;re aware that our book&#x2014;whatever its size&#x2014;can&#x2019;t do justice to all of the book artists and writers to whom, as writers and readers ourselves, we&#x2019;re clearly beholden. For some of this we would like to mention not only those with pieces listed in our table of contents but those also whose works are cited or included within the anthologized selections. While we&#x2019;re satis�ed that the book is ample in its inclusions, we want to point out&#x2014;as always&#x2014;that a gathering like this can only scratch the surface of what the past and present have given us to work from. </p><p>The selection of course is also personal, re�ective of our own experiences and needs, while hopeful that these will prove of use to others. We have moved forward in the hope that our readers will be able to construct a kind of narrative from these otherwise disparate pieces. To intensify the sense of a narrative&#x2014;or a series of such narratives&#x2014;we have taken the liberty of removing footnotes and bibliographic references unless, from our perspective or that of the authors, they added greatly to the story being told. We have also modi�ed the number of illustrations for certain pieces&#x2014;eliminating some or adding others&#x2014;and where we have selected a section from a larger work, we have eliminated references to material included elsewhere in that work but absent from our own. On the other hand, we have been �exible about stylistic features, particularly those that distinguish American from British written usage or, still more crucially, those that represent deliberate or contrarian move! s on the part of the authors. We have tried in this way&#x2014;and within the limits imposed on any material book&#x2014;to be faithful to the intentions of those whose works we&#x2019;re including. And we&#x2019;ve also attempted to present our readers with gifts like the facsmile of the Cendrars/Delaunay La Prose du Transsib�rien or the complete reprint of Jess&#x2019;s O!&#x2014;not for their economic feasability but for the pleasure it gives us to do so. </p><p>In the course of putting the work together, we are indebted to all those artists, writers and publishers whose work has come into our enterprise. If Mallarm� was right about the spiritual book&#x2014;the book that all of us are writing&#x2014;it may be possible to see each generation or overlap of generations as one chapter in that common (or communal) volume. Among those of our time who have most affected us&#x2014;separately or together&#x2014;in our thoughts about the book and writing, are Robert Duncan, Timothy Ely, Barbara Fahrner, Walter Hamady, Dick Higgins, Edmond Jab�s, Sherman Paul, Ian Tyson, and Tony Zwicker to any one of whom this book could well be dedicated. Others who shared the work with us include, most notably, Philip Gallo (as designer and assembler) and Amber Phillips (as organizer and reader), whose attentions moved us along from concept to material object. </p><p>And �nally, but centrally, we have also shared time and thoughts with Julie Harrison and Diane Rothenberg&#x2014;some of it in New York, some in California, and some in Paris&#x2014;and we have learned between ourselves as co-makers to work together on that adventure in writing and reading that forms so crucial a part of all our lives. </p><p>&#x2014;Jerome Rothenberg &#x2014;Steven Clay 1999/2000</p>Jerome Rothenberg is a poet and one of the world&#x2019;s leading anthologists.

There&#39;s a reason WESTERN CIVILIZATION is the best seller: it makes the &#34;story of history&#34; come alive. Spielvogel&#39;s text is also loaded with extras, like &#34;Film and History&#34; features that show you a new approach to studying history. Colorful maps and visuals, plus dramatic first-hand historical accounts, combine to bring to life the stories of the people and events that have shaped Western civilization.</p><p>Jackson J. Spielvogel is Associate Professor Emeritus of History at The Pennsylvania State University. He received his Ph.D. from The Ohio State University, where he specialized in Reformation history under Harold J. Grimm. His articles and reviews have appeared in journals such as Moreana, Journal of General Education, Catholic Historical Review, Archiv f�r Reformationsgeschichte, and American Historical Review. He also has contributed chapters or articles to The Social History of Reformation, THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE: A DICTIONARY HANDBOOK, the Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual of Holocaust Studies, and Utopian Studies. His work has been supported by fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation and the Foundation for Reformation Research. At Penn State, he helped inaugurate the Western Civilization course, as well as a popular course on Nazi Germany. His book HITLER AND NAZI GERMANY was published in 1987 (7th Edition, 2013). He is also the author of WESTERN CIVILIZATION, first published in 1991 (9th Edition, 2015). Professor Spielvogel has won five major university-wide teaching awards. During the year 1988?1989, he held the Penn State Teaching Fellowship, the university&#39;s most prestigious teaching award. In 1996, he won the Dean Arthur Ray Warnock Award for Outstanding Faculty member, and in 2000 received the Schreyer Honors College Excellence in Teaching Award."The faculty who adopted Spielvogel ... did so because the text read clearly and told a coherent story of historical change and development. Students comment that the text is well written, clearly organized, and interesting. Chapter titles and major headings mark chronological and thematic connections but place greatest emphasis on the conceptual development. ... National histories are mentioned but do not dominate; and art, literature, and music are not ignored. ... The special features are one of the greatest strengths of Spielvogel."<br><br>"The chronologies, timelines, and boxed documents all add greatly to the overall quality of the text. My students would be lost without them. ... I like this text and expect to continue to use it for the next several years."<br><br>"The Spielvogel text does a good job of communicating with students. The vocabulary ... is not too difficult, and the literary style is almost conversational."<br><br>"Dr. Spielvogel's lucid prose, apt illustrations, and excellent maps make his a text for which I find it difficult to imagine finding a close rival. ... The coherence resulting from its being a single-author text is valuable in a general education course. ... It is a very impressive textbook and the author and publisher alike ought to take great pride in their work. ... I would not only consider adopting Jackson J. Spielvogel's WESTERN CIVILIZATION text, but would, furthermore, actively lobby for its adoption for use at our university. A wealth of information in keeping with the scholarship at our disposal is presented in an appealing format. Never sacrificing well-written content, the text appeals to a generation reared on media in living color."</p><h2>The Day of the Scorpion</h2><p><p>In <i>The Day of the Scorpion</i>, Scott draws us deeper in to his epic of India at the close of World War II.

Conventionally viewed as worthless, incapable of sustained policy, and significant only for his sporadic displays of ill-directed energy or a stubborn adherence to greedy and ambitious favorites, he has been presented as fit only to be deposed and replaced by someone more worthy of the throne.<br><br>This definitive biography, the fruit of a lifetime&#x2019;s study, does not present Edward II as a heroic or successful king: his deposition after a turbulent reign of nearly twenty years is proof enough that it went terribly wrong. But Seymour Phillips&#x2019; scrutiny of the multitude of available sources shows that a richer picture emerges, in line with the complexity of events and of the man himself. If Edward II was not a successful king, he was not fundamentally different in many ways from most English monarchs. The biography strikes a deft balance, taking full account of the problems the king faced in England, Scotland, and Ireland and in his relations with France. It also tackles the contentious issue of whether Edward II did not die in 1327, murdered under barbaric circumstances, but lived on as a captive in England and then a wanderer on the Continent.

Interspersed with these themes are chapters on the Seleucids and their rivals, the Greeks of Bactria and India, the internal political life of Rome, and developments in Rome&#39;s relationships with her allies and neighbors in Italy.

Since 1960, he has made fourteen feature films and twenty short films and has written more than thirty books&#x2015;including three with Marxist philosopher Oskar Negt. His television production company has released more than 3,000 features, in which Kluge converses with real or fictional experts or creates thematic montages. He also maintains a website on which he reassembles segments from his film and television work. To call Kluge &#x201c;prolific&#x201d; would be an understatement. This is the first English-language monograph devoted to the full scope of Kluge's work, from his appearance on the cultural scene in the 1960s to his contributions to New German Cinema in the 1970s and early 1980s to his recent collaborations with such artists as Gerhard Richter. </p><p>In <i>Toward Fewer Images</i>, Philipp Ekardt offers both close analyses of Kluge's individual works and sustained investigations of his overarching (and perpetual) production. Ekardt discusses Kluge's image theory and practice as developed across different media, and considers how, in relation to this theory, Kluge returns to, varies, expands, and modifies the practice of montage, including its recent manifestations in digital media&#x2015;noting Kluge's counterintuitive claim that creating montages results in fewer images. Kluge's production, Ekardt argues, allows us to imagine a model of authorship and artistic production that does not rely on an accumulation of individual works over time but rather on a permanent activity of (temporalized) reworking and redifferentiation.</p></p><p>Philipp Ekardt is a Research Fellow London's School of Advanced Study-The Warburg Institute.

The book begins with the Caryl Chessman years (1948-60) and closes with the trial of the San Quentin Six (1975-76) and the passage of California's Determinate Sentencing Law (1977). This was an extraordinary era in the California prisons, one that saw the emergence of a highly developed radical convict resistance movement inside prison walls. This inmate groundswell was fueled at times by remarkable individual prisoners, at other times by groups like the Black Muslims or the San Quentin chapter of the Black Panther Party. But most often resistance grew from much wider sources and in quiet corners: from dozens of political study groups throughout the prison; from an underground San Quentin newspaper; and from covert attempts to organize a prisoners' union. The book traces the rise and fall of the prisoners' movement, ending with the inevitably bloody confrontation between prisoners and the state and the subsequent prison administration crackdown. The author examines the efforts of prison staff to augment other methods of inmate management by attempting to modify convict ideology by means of "bibliotherapy" and communication control, and describes convict resistance to these attempts as control. He also discusses how Bay Area political activists became intensely involved in San Quentin and how such writings as Chessman's <i>Cell 2455</i>, Cleaver's <i>Soul on Ice</i>, and Jackson's <i>Soledad Brother</i> reached far beyond prison walls to influence opinion, events, and policy.</p><p>This is a history of the California prison movement from 1950 to 1980, focusing on the San Francisco Bay Area&#39;s San Quentin State Prison and highlighting the role that prison reading and writing played in the creation of radical inmate ideology in those years.

Because of his ardent Puritan beliefs and natural talent for government and politics, he was appointed governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony. He became the foremost political leader in the colony for nearly 20 years, including twelve nonconsecutive terms as governor. When Winthrop and these new settlers arrived in the New World, they were aiming to create their own utopia, but they encountered difficulty and dissent. <p>In The Puritan Dilemma: John Winthrop, biographer Edmund Morgan helps us understand the motivations behind Puritan migration to America and the ideological and political difficulties they faced once they arrived. What does freedom mean? What is the proper role of the individual in society? Alongside the unfolding drama of a developing country, Morgan explores the life of John Winthrop and the core question of what level of responsibility people owe to their community and society.</p></p><p>Award-winning historian Edmund S.

The abundance of food in the United States--enough calories to meet the needs of every man, woman, and child twice over--has a downside.

Food companies in 2000 generated nearly $900 billion in sales. They have stakeholders to please, shareholders to satisfy, and government regulations to deal with. It is nevertheless shocking to learn precisely how food companies lobby officials, co-opt experts, and expand sales by marketing to children, members of minority groups, and people in developing countries. We learn that the food industry plays politics as well as or better than other industries, not least because so much of its activity takes place outside the public view.<br><br>Editor of the 1988 <i>Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health, </i>Nestle is uniquely qualified to lead us through the maze of food industry interests and influences. She vividly illustrates food politics in action: watered-down government dietary advice, schools pushing soft drinks, diet supplements promoted as if they were First Amendment rights. When it comes to the mass production and consumption of food, strategic decisions are driven by economics--not science, not common sense, and certainly not health.<br><br>No wonder most of us are thoroughly confused about what to eat to stay healthy. An accessible and balanced account, <i>Food Politics </i>will forever change the way we respond to food industry marketing practices. By explaining how much the food industry influences government nutrition policies and how cleverly it links its interests to those of nutrition experts, this pathbreaking book helps us understand more clearly than ever before what we eat and why.</p><p>In the U.S., we're bombarded with nutritional advice--the work, we assume, of reliable authorities with our best interests at heart. Far from it, says Marion Nestle, whose <i>Food Politics</i> absorbingly details how the food industry--through lobbying, advertising, and the co-opting of experts--influences our dietary choices to our detriment. Central to her argument is the American "paradox of plenty," the recognition that our food abundance (we've enough calories to meet every citizen's needs twice over) leads profit-fixated food producers to do everything possible to broaden their market portion, thus swaying us to eat <i>more</i> when we should do the opposite. The result is compromised health: epidemic obesity to start, and increased vulnerability to heart and lung disease, cancer, and stroke--reversible if the constantly suppressed "eat less, move more" message that most nutritionists shout could be heard. <p> Nestle, nutrition chair at New York University and editor of the 1988 Surgeon General Report, has served her time in the dietary trenches and is ideally suited to revealing how government nutritional advice is watered down when a message might threaten industry sales. (Her report on byzantine nutritional food-pyramid rewordings to avoid "eat less" recommendations is both predictable and astonishing.) She has other "war stories," too, that involve marketing to children in school (in the form of soft-drink "pouring rights" agreements, hallway advertising, and fast-food coupon giveaways), and diet-supplement dramas in which manufacturers and the government enter regulation frays, with the industry championing "free choice" even as that position counters consumer protection. Is there hope? "If we want to encourage people to eat better diets," says Nestle, "we need to target societal means to counter food industry lobbying and marketing practices as well as the education of individuals." It's a telling conclusion in an engrossing and masterfully panoramic expos�. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>"In this fascinating book we learn how powerful, intrusive, influential, and invasive big industry is and how alert we must constantly be to prevent it from influencing not only our own personal nutritional choices, but those of our government agencies. Marion Nestle has presented us with a courageous and masterful expos�."&#x2014;Julia Child<br><br>"This remarkable book is essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand how it has come to be that the richest nation in the world is eating itself to death.... Straight reporting about the shaping of food policy, as this volume makes clear, is certain to offend some very powerful players."&#x2014;Joan Dye Gussow, author of <i>This Organic Life</i><br><br>"Food politics underlie all politics in the United States. There is no industry more important to Americans, more fundamentally linked to our well-being and the future well-being of our children. Nestle reveals how corporate control of the nation's food system limits our choices and threatens our health. If you eat, you should read this book."&#x2014;Eric Schlosser, author of <i>Fast Food Nation </i><br><br>"'Blockbuster' is one of the best ways that I could describe this book.... A major contribution to understanding the interaction of politics and science, especially the science of nutrition, it is of extreme value to virtually all policy makers and to everyone concerned with the American diet."&#x2014;Sheldon Margen, editor of the <i>Berkeley Wellness Letter </i><br><br>"A devastating analysis of how the naked self-interest of America's largest industry influences and compromises nutrition policy and government regulation of food safety. . . . A clear translation of often obscure studies and cases, the writing is accessible and lively."&#x2014;Warren Belasco, author of <i>Appetite for Change </i></p><h2>Jelly&#39;s Blues: The Life, Music, And Redemption Of Jelly Roll Morton</h2><p>Jelly&#39;s Blues vividly recounts the tumultuous life of Jelly Roll Morton (1890-1941), born Ferdinand Joseph Lamonthe to a large, extended family in New Orleans. A virtuoso pianist with a larger-than-life personality, he composed such influential early jazz pieces as &#34;Kansas City Stomp&#34; and &#34;New Orleans Blues.&#34; But by the late 1930s, Jelly Roll Morton was nearly forgotten as a visionary jazz composer. Instead, he was caricatured as a braggart, a hustler, and, worst of all, a has-been. He was ridiculed by the white popular press and robbed of due royalties by unscrupulous music publishers. His reputation at rock bottom, Jelly Roll Morton seemed destined to be remembered more as a flamboyant, diamond-toothed rounder than as the brilliant architect of that new American musical idiom: Jazz.In 1992, the death of a New Orleans memorabilia collector unearthed a startling archive. Here were unknown later compositions as well as correspondence, court and copyright records, all detailing Morton&#39;s struggle to salvage his reputation, recover lost royalties, and protect the publishing rights of black musicians. Morton was a much more complex and passionate man than many had realized, fiercely dedicated to his art and possessing an unwavering belief in his own genius, even as he toiled in poverty and obscurity. An especially immediate and visceral look into the jazz worlds of New Orleans and Chicago, Jelly&#39;s Blues is the definitive biography of a jazz icon, and a long overdue look at one of the twentieth century&#39;s most important composers.</p><p><b>Howard Reich</b> is the veteran jazz critic of the Chicago Tribune and winner of the Deems Taylor Award, two William Jones Investigative Reporting Awards, and three Peter Lisagor Awards from the Society of Professional Journalists, among other honors.<b>William Gaines</b> retired from the Chicago Tribune in 2001, and is a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.There has been a resurgence of interest in Jelly Roll Morton (1890- 1941) in recent years, much of it highlighting the unattractive characteristics of the legendary Creole jazz pianist, composer and bandleader, such as his flashy clothes, diamond-studded tooth, boastfulness and denial of his race. In their sympathetic biography, Reich, jazz critic of the Chicago Tribune, and Gaines, an investigative reporter who retired from the Chicago Tribune in 2001, play down these aspects of Morton's personality and concentrate on his musicianship, keyboard virtuosity, innovative compositions and ingenuity in devising a way to set improvisational music down on paper. The authors also highlight the redemptive qualities of Morton's last years, basing their discussion on letters, documents and scores from the voluminous archive of Morton material in the collection of New Orleans jazz historian William Russell that became available after Russell's death in 1992. They show that at the end of his life Morton composed revolutionary new works, though he couldn't get anyone to play or record them. At the same time, he kept up a running battle with his publishers, who had exploited him for years, and launched a crusade against ASCAP (the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers), which collected royalties for composers and robbed black songwriters of what was due them by denying them membership. Morton's correspondence with the Justice Department concerning his case against ASCAP and his music publishers is included in the book (though not seen by PW), as an annotated discography. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Watercolor Bold &amp; Free: 64 Experimental Ideas and Techniques in Watercolor</h2><p>Vibrant alternatives to conventional ways of painting fill this best-selling book, helping watercolorists of all levels experience new dimensions of growth. <p>Sixty-four bold experiments promote originality in composition, concept, and technique.

Although circumstantial, the evidence against Hauptmann&#x2014;the handwriting on the ransom notes, the homemade kidnapping ladder, Colonel Lindbergh's money found in his garage, his matching the description of the man who accepted the ransom payoff in the Bronx cemetery, his inability to prove an alibi, and his incredible explanation of his possession of the ransom money&#x2014;was overwhelming, leaving few to doubt his guilt. After a series of appeals and stays, Hauptmann died fourteen months later in the electric chair. A confession would have spared him the death sentence, but Hauptmann chose to die maintaining his innocence.</p><p>It was not until the mid-1970s that revisionists began to challenge the conventional wisdom in the case: that Hauptmann was the lone killer. Revisionist books and articles appeared, as did plays, TV shows, and a movie, all portraying Hauptmann as the victim of a massive police and prosecution frame-up.</p><p>At this point, the focus shifted from the evidence to the conduct of the police. By the 1980s, most people familiar with the case were convinced of Hauptmann's complete innocence. Many denied the murder, believing that the Lindbergh baby remained alive. Several men claimed to be the firstborn son of Charles and Anne Lindbergh, one of whom sued to claim his share of the Lindbergh estate after Charles Lindbergh's death in 1974.</p><p>Another group held that the kidnapping was an elaborate hoax to cover up the murder of the baby by his parents. Anna Hauptmann�s series of federal lawsuits against New Jersey and others in the mid-1980s fueled further interest in the case. Although Hauptmann's widow lost all of her lawsuits, she had won the hearts and minds of the American people before her death at the age of ninety-four.</p><p>Former FBI agent Fisher discusses the hard evidence, such as the ransom notes and the wood of the kidnapping ladder. He analyzes and debunks the various revisionist theories and presents new evidence that, coupled with the undisputed facts, prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hauptmann was guilty as charged: he kidnapped and murdered the infant son of Charles and Anne Lindbergh.</p></p><p>The sad story of Charles Lindbergh's baby, kidnapped and murdered at the height of America's love affair with its aviator hero, is common knowledge, as is the scandal and corruption surrounding the conviction and execution of Bruno Hauptmann for that crime. In <i>The Ghosts of Hopewell</i>, Jim Fisher tells us another story, one more surprising in its lack of conspiracy and intrigue. Fisher writes simply, clearly, and with conviction--firmly convinced that Hauptmann was indeed the killer. As he sorts through the evidence, the testimony, the motives, and the crime itself, it becomes clear to the reader, too, that this was not simply a case of corrupt politicians and law enforcement officials trying to put a controversial murder to rest. It was, as believed originally, a case of an unemployed immigrant who saw an opportunity to make a few quick bucks on the brutal murder of the innocent child of America's celebrity of the day. <i>--Lisa Higgins</i><p><b>Jim Fisher</b>, who received an Edgar nomination for <i>Fall Guys: False Confessions and the Politics of Murder</i>, is a professor in the Department of Political Science and Criminal Justice at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.

That is their essence. When black holes collide, they will do so unilluminated. Yet the black hole collision is an event more powerful than any since the origin of the universe. The profusion of energy will emanate as waves in the shape of spacetime: gravitational waves. No telescope will ever record the event; instead, the only evidence would be the sound of spacetime ringing. In 1916, Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, his top priority after he proposed his theory of curved spacetime. One century later, we are recording the first sounds from space, the soundtrack to accompany astronomy&#x2019;s silent movie. <br><br>In <i>Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space,</i> Janna Levin recounts the fascinating story of the obsessions, the aspirations, and the trials of the scientists who embarked on an arduous, fifty-year endeavor to capture these elusive waves. An experimental ambition that began as an amusing thought experiment, a mad idea, became the object of fixation for the original architects&#x2014;Rai Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Ron Drever. Striving to make the ambition a reality, the original three gradually accumulated an international team of hundreds. As this book was written, two massive instruments of remarkably delicate sensitivity were brought to advanced capability. As the book draws to a close, five decades after the experimental ambition began, the team races to intercept a wisp of a sound with two colossal machines, hoping to succeed in time for the centenary of Einstein&#x2019;s most radical idea. Janna Levin&#x2019;s absorbing account of the surprises, disappointments, achievements, and risks in this unfolding story offers a portrait of modern science that is unlike anything we&#x2019;ve seen before.</p><p><b>JANNA LEVIN</b>&nbsp;is a professor of physics and astronomy at Barnard College of Columbia University. She is also director of sciences at Pioneer Works, a center for arts and sciences in Brooklyn, and has contributed to an understanding of black holes, the cosmology of extra dimensions, and gravitational waves in the shape of spacetime. Her previous books include <i>How the Universe Got Its Spots</i> and a novel, <i>A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines, </i>which won the PEN/Bingham Prize. She was recently named a Guggenheim fellow.<b>Excerpt</b><br>1<br><br>When Black Holes Collide<br><br>Somewhere in the universe two black holes collide&#x2014;�as heavy as stars, as small as cities, literally black (the complete absence of light) holes (empty hollows). Tethered by gravity, in their final seconds together the black holes course through thousands of revolutions about their eventual point of contact, churning up space and time until they crash and merge into one bigger black hole, an event more powerful than any since the origin of the universe, outputting more than a trillion times the power of a billion Suns. The black holes collide in complete darkness. None of the energy exploding from the collision comes out as light. No telescope will ever see the event.<br><br>That profusion of energy emanates from the coalescing holes in a purely gravitational form, as waves in the shape of spacetime, as gravitational waves. An astronaut floating nearby would see nothing. But the space she occupied would ring, deforming her, squeezing then stretching. If close enough, her auditory mechanism could vibrate in response. She would hear the wave. In empty darkness, she could hear spacetime ring. (Barring death by black hole.) Gravitational waves are like sounds without a material medium. When black holes collide, they make a sound.<br><br>No human has ever heard the sound of a gravitational wave. No instrument has indisputably recorded one. Traveling from the impact as fast as light to the Earth could take a billion years, and by the time the gravitational wave gets from the black hole collision to this planet, the din of the crash is imperceptibly faint. Fainter than that. Quieter than can be described with conventional superlatives. By the time the gravitational wave gets here, the ringing of space will involve relative changes in distance the width of an atomic nucleus over a stretch comparable to the span of three Earths.<br><br>A campaign to record the skies began a half century ago. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-�Wave Observatory (LIGO) is to date the most expensive undertaking ever funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent federal agency that supports fundamental scientific research. There are two LIGO observatories, one in Hanford, Washington, and the other in Livingston, Louisiana. Each machine frames 4 square kilometers. With integrated costs exceeding a billion dollars and an international collaboration of hundreds of scientists and engineers, LIGO is the culmination of entire careers and decades of technological innovation.<br><br>The machines were taken offline over the past few years for an upgrade to their advanced detection capabilities. Everything was replaced but the nothing&#x2014;�the vacuum&#x2014;�one of the experimentalists told me. In the meantime, calculations and computations are under way in groups across the world to leverage predictions of the universe at its noisiest. Theorists take the intervening years to design data algorithms, to build data banks, to devise methods to extract the most from the instruments. Many scientists have invested their lives in the experimental goal to measure &#x201c;a change in distance comparable to less than a human hair relative to 100 billion times the circumference of the world.&#x201d;<br><br>In the hopefully plentiful years that follow a first detection, the aspiration is for Earth-�based observatories to record the sounds of cataclysmic astronomical events from many directions and from varied distances. Dead stars collide and old stars explode and the big bang happened. All kinds of high-�impact mayhem can ring spacetime. Over the lifetime of the observatories, scientists will reconstruct a clanging discordant score to accompany the silent movie humanity has compiled of the history of the universe from still images of the sky, a series of frozen snapshots captured over the past four hundred years since Galileo first pointed a crude telescope at the Sun.<br><br>I follow this monumental experimental attempt to measure subtle shifts in the shape of spacetime in part as a scientist hoping to make a contribution to a monolithic field, in part as a neophyte hoping to understand an unfamiliar machine, in part as a writer hoping to document the first human-�procured records of bare black holes. As the global network of gravity observatories nears the final stretch of this race, it gets harder to turn attention away from the promise of discovery, although there are still those who vehemently doubt the prospects for success.<br><br>Under the gloom of a controversial beginning and the opposition of powerful scientists, grievous internal battles, and arduous technological dilemmas, LIGO recovered and grew, hitting projections and escalating in capability. Five decades after the experimental ambition began, we are on the eve of the crash of a colossal machine into a wisp of a sound. An idea sparked in the 1960s, a thought experiment, an amusing haiku, is now a thing of metal and glass. Advanced LIGO began to record the skies in the fall 2015, a century after Einstein published his mathematical description of gravitational waves. The instruments should reach optimum sensitivity within a year or two, maybe three. The early generation of machines proved the concept, but still success is never guaranteed. Nature doesn&#x2019;t always comply. The advanced machines will lock on and tolerate adjustments and corrections and calibrations and wait for something extraordinary to happen, while the scientists push aside their doubts and press toward the finish.<br><br>As much as this book is a chronicle of gravitational waves&#x2014;�a sonic record of the history of the universe, a soundtrack to match the silent movie&#x2014;�it is a tribute to a quixotic, epic, harrowing experimental endeavor, a tribute to a fool&#x2019;s ambition.<br><br>2<br><br>High Fidelity<br><br>At 6:00 pm the building is quiet for an MIT headquarters. I have to wait outside until a graduate student rolls up and pops off a bicycle to let me in the locked doors, carrying the bike with her up the stairs. &#x201c;Rai&#x2019;s office is straight down.&#x201d; She points to the hall behind her and wheels away, one foot jumped into the stirrup of the pedal, the other hanging on the same side. She hops off again and is inhaled by a pale office door. Rai&#x2019;s door looks exactly the same and I have the sense it would be easy to mistake offices, like mistaking hotel rooms.<br><br>Rainer Weiss waves me in. We skip conventional social openers and speak with familiarity, although this is our first meeting, as though we&#x2019;ve known each other for as long as imaginable, the shared experience of our scientific community outweighing a shared hometown or even generation. We lean back in mismatched chairs, our feet propped up on a single stool.<br><br>&#x201c;I started life with one ambition. I wanted to make music easier to hear. As a kid I was in the revolution of high fidelity. Because, look, I was a kid in around 1947. I built hi-�fis of the first kind. The immigrants that came to New York, most of them were very eager to listen to classical music.<br><br>&#x201c;See that loudspeaker there? That came from a movie theater in Brooklyn. Behind the screen you had a matrix of those things. I had twenty of them. I lugged them all on the subway. They had a huge fire at the Brooklyn Paramount, and they were getting rid of them. So I had what were movie-�studio quality loudspeakers and I had this fantastic circuit that I was building and I had FM radio. And I would invite friends over to listen to the New York Philharmonic and it was unbelievable. You felt like you were in the theater. An unbelievable sound came out of those things.&#x201d;<br><br>Rai gestures to the conical metal guts of a circa 1935 speaker. The raw frame has an exaggerated heft that design advances have banished but otherwise looks surprisingly technologically recent, more 1970s indulgence than 1930s necessity. The object fits in visually with the other metal frames from various apparatuses that are stashed around the hive of scientists attending to a gravitational instrument that first imposed itself as a compelling thought experiment in the 1960s. Although he would later find out he wasn&#x2019;t the first, Rai dreamed up a device to record the sound of spacetime ringing. A paragon of scientific ambition, the experiment is now too colossal for this building or even for Cambridge, Massachusetts. An R&amp;D laboratory to develop some of the machines&#x2019; components is housed in the basement of the building next door, while the fully integrated instruments are constructed on remote sites.<br><br>In 2005, Rai molted the venerable role of professor of physics at MIT so he could walk 4 kilometer cement tunnels, affix oscilloscopes to laser beam tubes, appraise 18,000 cubic meters of hard vacuum for leaks, and measure seismic vibrations in dank wasp-�infested enclosures. Rai seceded essentially for the privilege to reemerge as a student again but with the elevation of the august title offered the most admired retired&#x2014;�but active&#x2014;�faculty: professor emeritus.</p><h2>Aventuras en la Ciudad</h2><p>No writing or highlighting.

Unfolding over the course of two years, Barthes engaged in a unique pedagogical experiment: he combined teaching and writing to "simulate" the trial of novel-writing, exploring every step of the creative process along the way.<br><br>Barthes's lectures move from the desire to write to the actual decision making, planning, and material act of producing a novel. He meets the difficulty of transitioning from short, concise notations (exemplified by his favorite literary form, haiku) to longer, uninterrupted flows of narrative, and he encounters a number of setbacks. Barthes takes solace in a diverse group of writers, including Dante, whose <i>La Vita Nuova</i> was similarly inspired by the death of a loved one, and he turns to classical philosophy, Taoism, and the works of Fran�ois-Ren� Chateaubriand, Gustave Flaubert, Franz Kafka, and Marcel Proust. <br><br>This book uniquely includes eight elliptical plans for Barthes's unwritten novel, which he titled <i>Vita Nova</i>, and lecture notes that sketch the critic's views on photography. Following on <i>The Neutral: Lecture Course at the Coll�ge de France (1977-1978)</i> and a third forthcoming collection of Barthes lectures, this volume provides an intensely personal account of the labor and love of writing.</p><p>Roland Barthes (1915-1980) was one of the most influential critics and philosophers of the twentieth century.

Eliot as one of the chief sources for his great poem "The Waste Land," Jessie L. Weston's <i>From Ritual to Romance</i> remains a landmark of anthropological and mythological scholarship. In this book she explores the origins of the Grail legend, arguing that it dates back to a primitive vegetation cult and only later was shaped by Celtic and Christian lore.<br>To prove her thesis, Weston unites folkloric and Christian elements by using printed texts to prove the parallels existing between each and every feature of the legend of the Holy Grail and the recorded symbolism of the ancient mystery cults. Specifically, she finds the origin of the Grail legend in a Gnostic text that served as a link between such cults and later Celtic and Christian elaborations of the myth.<br>With erudition and critical acumen, the author provides illuminating insights into diverse aspects of the legend: the task of the hero; the freeing of the waters; medieval and modern forms of nature ritual; the symbols of the cult (cup, lance, sword, stone, etc.); the symbolism of the fisher king; the significance of such deities as Tammuz, Adonis, Mithra, and Attis; the meaning of the adventure of the Perilous Chapel in Grail romances; and much more.<br>Awarded the Crawshay Prize in 1920, this scholarly yet highly readable study will interest any student of the Arthurian legends, mythology, ancient religion, and Eliot's poetry.</p><p>Acknowledged by T. S. Eliot as crucial to understanding &#39;The Waste Land, &#39; Jessie Weston&#39;s book has continued to attract readers interested in ancient religion, myth, and especially Arthurian legend. Here she reinterprets the saga of the Grail by exploring the legend&#39;s Gnostic roots.<b>Jessie L. Weston</b> (1850-1928) wrote fourteen books, most of them on Arthurian legend.</p><h2>Learning in the Global Era: International Perspectives on Globalization and Education</h2><p>An international gathering of leading scholars, policymakers, and educators takes on some of the most difficult and controversial issues of our time in this groundbreaking exploration of how globalization is affecting education around the world. The contributors, drawing from innovative research in both the social sciences and the neurosciences, examine the challenges and opportunities now facing schools as a result of massive migration flows, new economic realities, new technologies, and the growing cultural diversity of the world&#39;s major cities. Writing for a wide audience, they address such questions as: How do we educate all youth to develop the skills and sensibilities necessary to thrive in globally linked, technologically interconnected economies? What can schools do to meet the urgent need to educate growing numbers of migrant youth at risk of failure in societies already divided by inequality? What are the limits of cultural tolerance as tensions over gender, religion, and race threaten social cohesion in schools and neighborhoods alike? Bringing together scholars with deep experience in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, this work, grounded in rich examples from everyday life, is highly relevant not only to scholars and policymakers but also to all stakeholders responsible for the day-to-day workings of schools in cities across the globe.</p><p>"In <i>Learning in the Global Era</i>, Marcelo Su�rez-Orozco has integrated a rich harvest of practical wisdom with cutting-edge research in cognitive theory to produce an indispensable handbook for all who are grappling with the challenges of education in our rapidly changing world. With their interdisciplinary approach and their attention to cultural diversity, the essays are a treasure trove of insights and constructive approaches to which educators and policy-makers will return again and again."&#x2015;Mary Ann Glendon, Harvard University; President, Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences<br><br>"Neither developed nor developing nations have begun to prepare young people for the demands of the global economy; nor does schooling anywhere adequately respond to the massive migration of families whose home languages, cultures, and social structures differ from those in the new host nation. Besides providing vivid and rigorous accounts of the shifting population patterns, employment markets, and cultural and political change, this fascinating book presents promising educational innovations that put student engagement and the global context for learning at the center. No other book so effectively joins emerging research on cognition and learning with the political and economic challenges of globalization."&#x2015;Martha Minow, Harvard Law School, and co-editor of <i>Engaging Cultural Differences</i><br><br>"<i>Learning in the Global Era</i> is a masterful book. Each of the essays, exquisitely arranged and coordinated by the editor, is a memorable example of rigorous interdisciplinary analysis and insight into emerging global issues. The range of concerns&#x2015;from nurturing a global consciousness and appreciating the simultaneous cultural patterns that children develop in global cities, often through their own migration, to the effects of gender-specific dilemmas in global classrooms-makes this book a compendium for more than understanding a world which challenges many traditional assumptions. But reading it does more; it makes us mindful of the difficulty and also of the necessary creativity involved in learning and teaching today. I am grateful for its lessons and the readers will be, too."&#x2015;Doris Sommer, Harvard University<br><br>"Globalization is transforming entire economies and cultures, but schools and schooling have not kept pace. Marcelo Su�rez-Orozco has assembled a set of thoughtful and incisive essays by international experts that show how globalization makes it imperative to rethink and reform the education of children in every part of the planet. Educating citizens in the advanced countries to understand global society and cultural differences, increasing access to education in the developing world while teaching new skills, finding ways to help immigrants adapt and succeed in their new surroundings&#x2015;all these essential tasks are addressed in this important book."&#x2015;John H. Coatsworth, Columbia University<br><br>"How should this generation of youth, the largest ever in human history, be educated? How do we make sure all youth have access to quality education? What cognitive skills, interpersonal sensibilities, and ethical norms should be nourished in youth to live and thrive in our global world? Learning in the Global Era addresses these and other questions with both scholarly rigor and humane concern. It brings together leading international scholars&#x2015; including anthropologists, cognitive scientists, economists, education scholars, linguists, neuroscientists, and psychologists with extensive research experience in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, to examine the education of youth for the 21st Century. It is a work that breaks new ground by locating learning and youth engagement in the ever more complex economic, social, and cultural realities that define the world's global cities."&#x2015;Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, and High Commissioner for Human Rights<b>Marcelo M.

It invites us to re-examine and rearrange our lives, to sweep away the "clutter" that keeps us from contact with the world, with God, with our own souls. It provides further images of the abundant life and suggests ways of moving toward it personally and culturally. It shares practical suggestions that cover topics such as personal consumer choices and service projects to reinvigorating community life and traditional celebrations.<p>Whether reading through it alone or using the insightful study guide with a group, Simpler Living, Compassionate Life invites you into the dialogue.</p></p><p>This book is a tremendous resource...The multitude of prayers here share the feelings, emotions, and concerns of people throughout the past two milleniums. The historical aspect of this book is significant. The prayer expressions go back through the centuries to Jesus Christ.

In this exhaustively researched book, veteran oil industry analyst Matthew Simmons draws on his three-plus decades of insider experience and more than 200 independently produced reports about Saudi petroleum resources and production operations. He uncovers a story about Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s troubled oil industry, not to mention its political and societal instability, which differs sharply from the globally accepted Saudi version. It&#x2019;s a story that is provocative and disturbing, based on undeniable facts, but until now never told in its entirety. Twilight in the Desert answers all readers&#x2019; questions about Saudi oil and production industries with keen examination instead of unsubstantiated posturing, and takes its place as one of the most important books of this still-young century.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is the most important <p>oil producing nation in history. The secretive Saudi government repeatedly assures the world that its oil fields are healthy beyond reproach, and that they can maintain and even increase output at will to meet skyrocketing global demand.</p> <p>But what if they can't?</p> <p>Twilight in the Desert looks behind the curtain to reveal a Saudi oil and production industry that could soon approach a serious, irreversible decline. In this exhaustively researched book, veteran oil industry analyst Matthew Simmons draws on his own three-plus decades of insider experience and more than 200 independently produced reports about Saudi petroleum resources and production operations. What he uncovers is a story about Saudi Arabia's troubled oil industry, not to mention its political and societal instability, which differs sharply from the globally accepted Saudi version.</p> <p>It's a story that is provocative and disturbing, based on undeniable facts, but until now never told in its entirety. Twilight in the Desert examines numerous aspects of Saudi Arabia and its looming oil crisis, including:</p> <ul> <li>The seventy-year history of modern Saudi Arabia, and the truth behind its troubling mix of monarchy, conservative Islam, severe social restrictions, and economic contradictions</li> <li>Why the geological phenomena that created Saudi oil invincibility now threaten to bring it to an end, far sooner than the world has been led to believe</li> <li>A field-by-field assessment of twelve key Saudi oil fields, and how verified shortfalls in their production and potential stand sharply at odds with unverifiable Saudi rhetoric</li> </ul> <p>While Saudi officials promise to increase production from current levels if necessary, Twilight in the Desert examines the history of other major oil fields to determine that Saudi Arabia is in fact overproducing its primary resources, and couldn't possibly ramp up production for long. It calls for long-overdue transparency on the part of the Saudis and all significant global oil producers, along with urgently needed energy data reform, and a global energy blueprint for how the world will cope once Saudi oil output has peaked.</p> <p>Without question, Saudi Arabian oil fields provide the rest of the world with its most plentiful, low-cost oil resource. The question is how long can they continue to keep these critical pipelines open. Twilight in the Desert answers that question with keen examination instead of unsubstantiated posturing, and takes its place as one of the most important books of this still-young century.</p><b>Praise for <i>Twilight in the Desert</i></b> <p>"This book is likely to be the most important ever written about oil. The veil of secrecy that has surrounded the world's oil resources must be lifted so the world can plan its future. This magnificently researched book of Matt Simmons may very well have the power to make that happen."<br> &#x2014;<b>Richard E. Smalley</b>, PhD, Nobel Laureate&#x2013;Chemistry (1996), University Professor Gene and Norman Hackerman Professor of Chemistry Professor of Physics, Rice University</p> <p>"Simmons effectively confronts the complacent notion that there are ample oil reserves in Saudi Arabia. Twilight in the Desert should provoke anyone who believes that the recent increase in oil prices reflects either a speculative bubble or short-term supply constraints. It should provoke elected governments that have been complacent about their public's lack of concern about energy policy. And it will inevitably provoke producers like Saudi Arabia who believe they can maintain the veil of secrecy over their resources base that the world so strongly depends on."<br> &#x2014;<b>Edward L. Morse</b>, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Energy Policy</p> <p>"Everyone must understand this thesis, whether you agree or not, since it may change life as we know it."<br> &#x2014;<b>Jim Rogers</b>, author of <i>Hot Commodities and Adventure Capitalist</i></p> <p>"Matt Simmons has made an important contribution to a better understanding of the complexity of oil field management in Saudi Arabia. His book is a challenge to Middle Eastern oil producers to provide the world with more and better oil field data, which are needed for a better understanding of when existing oil fields may peak. Instead of 'believe me,' he is asking the simple question 'show me' because the timing of oil peaking in the Middle East is essential for energy policy makers around the world. If Simmons proves directionally correct, we are in for a huge and early challenge to find alternative transportation fuels."<br> &#x2014;<b>Dr. Herman Franssen</b>, President, International Energy Associates, Inc.</p> <p>"Twilight in the Desert provides much-needed transparency to a subject long hidden from public view.

In keeping with the preference for a "How do we know?" rather than "What do we know?" approach, the authors stress what assumptions are made by earth historians, what kinds of evidence (and tools for gathering that evidence), and what processes of reasoning and limitations of hypotheses are involved in reconstructing and interpreting the past.<p>Each chapter begins with a list of highlights entitled "Major Concepts". Many chapters have a summary timeline that puts the entire sequence of events into a quick visual reference frame. The use of dioramas and reconstructions of extinct animals and plants has been greatly expanded, so that students can get a more vivid concept of typical life in any part of the geologic past. In many places, the authors have supplied a full page of color photos of classic fossils from each period to improve the visual recognition of the organisms that give life its distinctive history. The areas of hottest controversy, such as mass extinctions, dinosaur endothermy, the origin of life, and controversies over late Proterozoic tectonics and glaciation, have been given separate sections so that students can appreciate the different sides of the debates.

Selected by Paul Vangelisti, this volume comprises the fullest spectrum of Baraka's rousing, revolutionary poems, from his first collection to previously unpublished pieces composed during his final years.<br><br>Throughout Baraka&#x2019;s career as a prolific writer (also published as LeRoi Jones), he was vehemently outspoken against oppression of African American citizens, and he radically altered the discourse surrounding racial inequality. The environments and social values that inspired his poetics changed during the course of his life, a trajectory that can be traced in this retrospective spanning more than five decades of profoundly evolving subjects and techniques. Praised for its lyricism and introspection, his early poetry emerged from the Beat generation, while his later writing is marked by intensely rebellious fervor and subversive ideology. All along, his primary focus was on how to live and love in the present moment despite the enduring difficulties of human history.</p><p><b>Amiri Baraka</b> (1934-2014) was an author of poetry, plays, essays, fiction, and music criticism, as well as a groundbreaking political activist who lectured in the United States, the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe. He served as Poet Laureate of New Jersey from 2002-2003, and his numerous accolades include fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, the Langston Hughes Medal from the City College of New York, the Rockefeller Foundation Award for Drama, a PEN Open Book Award, induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Before Columbus Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award.<b>Praise for <i>S O S: Poems 1961-2013</i></b><br><br>"The most complete representation of over a half-century of revolutionary and breathtaking work." <b>Claudia Rankine, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"<i>S O S</i> provides readers with rich, vital views of the African American experience and of Baraka&#x2019;s own evolution as a poet-activist. . . . Baraka is as adept with spare, imagistic lines as with lyrical realism. Racist, provincial ideas earn his angry unmasking as he sings, shouts and shakes a fist at corruption and ignorance." <i><b>Washington Post</b></i><br><br>"A big handsome book of Amiri Baraka's poetry [that gives] us word magic, wit, wild thoughts, discomfort, and pleasure." <b>William J. Harris, <i>Boston Review</i></b><br><br>"Amiri Baraka&#x2019;s <i>S O S</i> sparks a living flame. Bodacious and tenacious, he remains a realist rooted sometimes in the political, sometimes in the avant-garde. His voice is made in America; his poetry is an action. Baraka&#x2019;s poems live on and off the page and demand that we feel language as music and meaning. This poet and his work are always slipping the yoke, determined to be free yes, aesthetic freedom lives within <i>S O S</i>.

Highly recommended." <i><b>Library Journal</b></i><b> (starred review)</b><br><br>"In a climate of renewed outrage over injustice, the voice of the recently departed Amiri Baraka is more relevant than ever, his volatile lyric poems ringing as true today as they did fifty years ago. A career retrospective that captures not just a man, but a movement." <i><b>Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b></i><br><br>"What's best about Baraka&#x2019;s verse is that his historical sensibility and sense of historical dread bump elbows with anarchic comedy. . . . <i>S O S</i> is the best overall selection we have thus far of Baraka&#x2019;s work." <b>Dwight Garner, <i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>"These poems cover the ebbs and flows of the modern African-American struggle for freedom and identity . . . There may be no better time than now to experience the lyrical, funny, dynamic, and provocative poetry of Amiri Baraka . . . <i>S O S</i> is the perfect place to hear the voice that influenced, if not defined, decades of black political struggle when few were listening and even fewer were doing anything.

Now, more than a decade into the next century, no one can ignore it. </p> <p><em>A New Environmental Ethics: the Next Millennium for Life on Earth</em> offers clear, powerful, and oftentimes moving thoughts from one of the first and most respected philosophers to write on the environment. Rolston, an early and leading pioneer in studying the moral relationship between humans and the earth, surveys the full spectrum of approaches in the field of environmental ethics. This book, however, is not simply a judicious overview. Instead, it offers critical assessments of contemporary academic accounts and draws on a lifetime of research and experience to suggest an outlook for the future. As a result, this focused, forward-looking analysis will be a necessary complement to any balanced textbook or anthology in environmental ethics, and will teach its readers to be responsible global citizens, and residents of their landscape, helping ensure that the future we have will be the one we wish for.</p></p><p><p><strong>Holmes Rolston III</strong> is University Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. </p><p><strong>"This is an introduction to environmental ethics that only Holmes Rolston could write- at once gut-wrenchingly direct and poetically-inspired, it will attract new generations to the field that he did so much to create."</strong> <em>&#x2013;Dale Jamieson, New York University</em></p> <p><strong>"Holmes Rolston's<em>&nbsp;A New Environmental Ethics</em> is new in the best sense: an honest, fresh appraisal of where we are and where we are heading.&nbsp; It likewise is old in the best sense. There comes a time to reflect on where we have been and why, what we have accomplished, and what we stand for. This is Rolston's time, and his is a voice that will be heard across generations."</strong>&nbsp; <strong>&#x2013;</strong><em>David Schmidtz, University of Arizona</em></p> <p><strong>"A succinct overview of the field from its most important thinker, this book is the indispensable introduction to environmental ethics."</strong> <em>&#x2013;Willis Jenkins, Yale University</em></p> <p><strong>"With characteristic rigor, Rolston proves once again to be a moral explorer <em>par excellence</em>.&nbsp; His new book not only surveys the existing terrain of environmental ethics literature, but it persuasively argues for following a greener, more life-respecting morality; it is an exemplary read for an environmental ethics course."</strong> </p> <p><em>&#x2013;Ben Dixon, Stephen F. Austin State University</em></p> <p><strong>"I would recommend Rolston&#x2019;s book for any undergraduate course in environmental ethics, or even for an introductory ethics course with a substantial applied ethical component. The book&#x2019;s plain language makes it easy to read yet philosophically challenging as only the work of a discipline&#x2019;s founder could be." </strong></p><i> <p>-International Society for Environmental Ethics Newsletter</p></i> <p><strong>"The book's clear writing and relatively brief length should make it an easy read for students . . . . Probably its greatest value is that it is Rolston speaking to anyone who might be wise enough to listen. He covers all the important issues, including the various views of important--sometimes obscure--environmental philosophers; he also discusses US legislation and the state of life on Earth. Summing Up: Highly recommended."</strong></p> <p><em>-Choice </em></p></p><h2>The Search for Life in the Universe (Third Edition)</h2><p>Long recognized as the Gold Standard text for astrobiology courses, The Search for Life in the Universe now appears in a completely revised and updated Third Edition. This book engages students in astronomy by presenting a great, unsolved mystery: How likely is life beyond earth, and how can we find it if it exists? The text covers the fundamentals of astronomy and astrophysics, including the discovery of more than 55 planets around other stars, and also provides an overview of biology, geology, evolution, and the possibilities of interstellar travel and communication. Written for readers with no background in mathematics, the book includes 24 color insert pages and brilliantly rendered illustrations by Jon Lomberg.</p><p>Donald Goldsmith was the science editor and co-writer of the PBS television series The Astronomers and the co-writer of NOVA&#39;s Is Anybody Out There? with Lily Tomlin.

It is important for each student of the Bible to gain information about the history and geography of the Bible in order to better understand the context of the message of salvation. The Waldrons have demonstrated an ability to take difficult material and make it both understandable and usable. The book can do several things for the user: (1) it will provide a complete survey of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation; (2) it will give one a good summary of the history of the nations involved in sacred history; (3) it will acquaint one with the geography of the Bible lands. The good maps add tremendously to the quality and usefulness of the book. There are a total of 52 lessons. The first lessons discuss man as an intelligent being. The next 7 lessons give a brief look at all the Bible Lands. The rest of the lessons (9-52) correlate the Bible history and geography together. There are plenty of full color maps with corresponding blank maps for the student to fill in. Every few lessons, there is a section of review questions. Charts, lists, and easily read narrative make this a great study for your Bible class or personal study.</p><p></p><h2>Gray Ghost: The Life of Col. John Singleton Mosby</h2><p><p>Confederate John Singleton Mosby forged his reputation on the most exhilarating of military activities: the overnight raid. Mosby possessed a genius for guerrilla and psychological warfare, taking control of the dark to make himself the "Gray Ghost" of Union nightmares. <i>Gray Ghost</i>, the first full biography of Confederate raider John Mosby, reveals new information on every aspect of Mosby's life, providing the first analysis of his impact on the Civil War from the Union viewpoint.</p></p><p>"Mosby achieved far greater fame during the Civil War than the vast majority of the military officers who outranked him. Ramage disentangles Mosby from a mass of myth and misinformation, reaching judicious conclusions that never exaggerate the Virginian's role in shaping the conflict."--Gary W. Gallagher <p>"A stirring story in its first half, like something out of Robin Hood or Camelot, and sad in the second half, as the South turns its back on Mosby after the War for supporting Grant for president and as the State Department tries to suppress his exposing of corruption among appointed officers serving in foreign embassies."--Southern Seen </p><p>&#x201c;The last word belongs to Lee, who always admired dash and daring. &#x2018;Hurrah for Mosby!

Comprehensive and convincing.&#x201d;&#x2014;Chronicles </p><p>&#x201c;No biographer of Mosby has woven the various threads of Mosby&#x2019;s life together as deftly as Ramage does in this portrait of one of the Civil War&#x2019;s most compelling figures.&#x201d;&#x2014;Civil War Times </p><p>&#x201c;Diligently explores the hardships of Mosby&#x2019;s postwar career, a period too often neglected by those who seek to make Mosby an icon of unreconstructed southernism.&#x201d;&#x2014;Virginia Magazine of History and Biography</p><p>James A.

After more than 15 years working with hundreds of companies, he knows that the vast majority of employees addicted to entitlement actually want to engage, want to contribute, and feel much better about themselves when they are in an environment that requires them to do so.</p> <p>Now, with <i>Ownership Thinking</i>, Hams shares his strategy that will increase your company&#x2019;s productivity, employee retention, and profitability: </p><ul> <li><b>The Right Education:</b> Teach employees the fundamentals of business and finance, how their company makes money, and how they add&#x2015;or take away&#x2015;value. </li><li><b>The Right Measures:</b> Identify the organization&#x2019;s Key Performance Indicators and teach employees to forecast results in an environment of high visibility and accountability. </li><li><b>The Right Incentives:</b> Create incentive plans that are self-funding and clearly align employees&#x2019; behavior to the organization&#x2019;s business and financial objectives.</li></ul> <p>Your employees will learn to think and act like owners and will become active participants in the financial performance of the business. They will gain the self-esteem that is only possible through achievement and will reap rewards that are in alignment with the success of their organization. Meanwhile, you will enjoy your role more, sleep better at night, and leave a legacy that is far more inspiring and significant than you dreamed possible.</p> <p><b>Praise for <i>Ownership Thinking</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;You would have to read a dozen other books to even come close to Ownership Thinking&#x2015;a systematic and practical process for getting your employees to give that extra effort and brain power we know they possess.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Verne Harnish, CEO, Gazelles; author, <i>Mastering the Rockefeller Habits</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Brad Hams tells it like it truly is: transparency creates trust; trust creates engagement; engagement creates a healthy enterprise.

Hailed by Bertrand Russell as a 'vigorous and profound defence of democracy', its now legendary attack on the philosophies of Plato, Hegel and Marx exposed the dangers inherent in centrally planned political systems. Popper's highly accessible style, his erudite and lucid explanations of the thought of great philosophers and the recent resurgence of totalitarian regimes around the world are just three of the reasons for the enduring popularity of <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em>, and for why it demands to be read both today and in years to come. This is the second of two volumes of <em>The Open Society and Its Enemies</em>.</p><p>&#39;A work of first-class importance which ought to be widely read for its masterly criticism of the enemies of democracy, ancient and modern.&#39;-Bertrand Russell<strong>Karl Popper</strong> (1902-1994). Philosopher, born in Vienna. One of the most influential and controversial thinkers of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Little Women (Vintage Classics)</h2><p><i>Little Women</i>&nbsp;has long been one of the most enduringly beloved classics of children's literature, as popular with adults as it is with young readers. Generations have been entranced by the adventures of the four March sisters, each with their distinct and realistic virtues and flaws: tomboyish, ambitious Jo; frail and sweet Beth; beautiful, confident Meg; and artistic, willful Amy. With their patient mother, Marmee, they survive the hardships of the Civil War and the dramas and tragedies of family life. First published in 1868, and based on Louisa May Alcott's own unusual family, the novel brought to life some of American literature's most vibrant female characters.</p><p>LOUISA MAY ALCOTT (1832 -1888) was an American writer best known for her novel&nbsp;<i>Little Women</i>&nbsp;and its sequels,&nbsp;<i>Little Men</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Jo's Boys</i>, which were inspired by her own family. She was raised by Transcendentalist parents in New England and grew up knowing many prominent intellectuals, including Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Longfellow.<b>Playing Pilgrims</b><br><br> "Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,"grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.<br><br> "It's so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.<br><br> "I don't think it's fair for some girls to have lots of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy, with an injured sniff.<br><br> "We've got father and mother, and each other, anyhow," said Beth, contentedly, from her corner.<br><br> The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly:<br><br> "We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time." She didn't say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking of father far away, where the fighting was.<br><br> Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, "You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas, was because it's going to be a hard winter for every one; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't;" and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.<br><br> "But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want to buy <i>Undine and Sintram</i> for myself; I've wanted it so long,' said Jo, who was a bookworm.<br><br> "I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.<br><br> "I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need them," said Amy, decidedly.<br><br> "Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we grub hard enough to earn it," cried Jo, examining the heels of her&nbsp;boots in a gentlemanly manner.<br><br> "I know I do, teaching those dreadful children nearly all day, when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the complaining tone again.<br><br> "You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to fly out of the window or box her ears?"<br><br> "It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get so stiff, I can't practise good a bit." And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.<br><br> "I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy; "for you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice."<br><br> "If you mean libel I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if pa was a pickle-bottle," advised Jo, laughing.</p><h2>Essential Statistics</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This reader-friendly book covers all information essential to statistics in the social sciences, from z-tests to the two-way ANOVA.

Since that time, she has been teaching and conducting research at Georgia Southern University. Her teaching includes courses in statistics, research methods, large sections of introductory psychology, and physiological psychology. Teaching and research merged when she was awarded a National Science Foundation grant as principal investigator for a physiological teaching laboratory, and a recent grant from the National Institute of Mental Health continues to fund her research program. She works with both undergraduates and graduate students on research projects involving social buffering of stress responses in rats and human adults and children. Dr. Wilson also conducts research on student evaluations of instructor immediacy and their ability to predict students' attitudes, motivation, and grades. She was honored with the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences Award for Excellence in 1997, the Award of Distinction in Teaching in 2003, and the Georgia Southern University Award for Excellence in Contributions to Instruction in 2004. </p><p><b>To the Instructor</b></p> <p><b> <i>Why Another Statistics Book?</i> </b></p> <p> I have been teaching statistics for about ten years, and one thing remains consistent: The majority of psychology students are not overjoyed to learn statistics. When I ask them why, they often tell me they aren't good at math and statistics is a baring course. While I appreciate their candid replies, I don't think their perceptions are accurate. They can be good at math, and statistics doesn't have to be a boring course. </p> <p> In this textbook, every effort is made to </p> <ol> <li>reduce anxiety about statistics,</li> <li>make statistics relevant and interesting, and</li> <li>incorporate SPSS to show students how to analyze data efficiently.</li> </ol> <p> To reduce anxiety, Chapter 1 opens with pointers on how to become competent in the course, with the final point reminding students that we're on their side. We want them to succeed and are delighted to record high grades when they are earned. Chapter 1 also contains a section on math, and students can quickly see that calculations required in statistics are quite simple. To further demonstrate that the math required of them is not difficult, over 30 practice items are offered at the end of this chapter. Within the first few class meetings, students should begin to recognize that they can perform well in statistics if they apply themselves, and we are available to help if they need us. </p> <p> In addition to a simple introduction to the course in Chapter 1, the entire text is written in a conversational style to further reduce anxiety. Although several reader-friendly supplemental statistics texts have become available over the past few years, this book is the first that offers the same readability and covers all information essential to a statistics course, from z-tests to the two-way ANOVA. In fact, I have also included brief Appendices on the repeated-measures ANOVA and multiple regression for instructors who choose to cover them. Every chapter and appendix is written in a straightforward way that my students have found accessible. </p> <p> Within each chapter, the material is segmented into many sections and subsections to allow students to digest the material at their own pace without stopping in the middle of a long stretch of text. The final section of each chapter is a preview of the subsequent chapter. The Preview summarizes the current chapter and links the material with the next chapter to help students see connections between topics. Finally, anxiety is reduced by offering students many practice items, which have been divided into Conceptual and Application categories. Conceptual Items are definitional or based on theory presented in the chapter. </p> <ul> <li>"What measure of variability must be used with ordinal data?"</li> <li>"When designing an experiment, why do researchers prefer a dependent variable of interval or ratio values?"</li> <li>"Why is it illogical to compare diagonal cell means after discovering a significant interaction?"</li> </ul> <p> Answers to these items can easily be found within the chapter to help students test themselves on their memory of the material. Application Items are more involved, requiring students to analyze an example in detail, often including calculations. </p> <p> A second Application Item example allows students to explore the relationship between age and respect. </p> <p> For both Conceptual and Application Item sections, more challenging items tend to be found toward the end of each category, and answers to odd-numbered items are located at the back of the book. Answers to all even-numbered items are found in the <b>instructor's manual,</b> and the <b>student workbook</b> provides larger data sets and a look at studies published by undergraduates. </p> <p> To address students' concern that statistics is a boring course, I have tried to share my passion for teaching statistics in this textbook. For several years, passion in teaching has been a hot topic among instructors, and encouraging student enthusiasm is a primary goal. Discussions have centered around getting and keeping students' attention in order to teach effectively, and we have begun to embrace the idea of entertaining while teaching. In this text, I have tried to entertain through examples that are relevant to most college students, including examples that have made my students laugh, nod their heads in agreement, or analyze enthusiastically to reach the answer. Because students should recognize that scientific knowledge is established through research, several examples are based on the results of published studies, and references are found at the end of relevant chapters. </p> <p> In addition to interesting examples, the text includes only analyses that (a) are necessary to build skills or (b) will likely be used by students in the future. Many of us can attest to the frustration (and boredom) associated with learning more than we want to know. I had this experience when I was taught how to build a website; to my dismay, I was also taught the inner workings of my computer. I found myself tuning out the information that, by my teacher's own admission, would not be relevant to me. This text presents statistics chosen as highly relevant based on talking with colleagues, reading their research, and experiencing my own needs when analyzing data from my lab. Further, each discussion of inferential statistics contains information that students are likely to need, including effect size, confidence intervals, and a model APA-style results section. </p> <p> A third goal of this text is to teach SPSS. Most campuses have access to this computer program, and it is currently the most popular program for data analysis. I require my students to learn how to conduct analyses by hand before turning to computers because hand calculations allow students to play an active role in finding the result of an example. Formulas also tend to reflect the logic behind analyses. I've also noticed that the majority of my students have difficulty relating to the material when they stare at a computer screen. However, SPSS offers a level of efficiency students would never enjoy if they continued to rely on hand calculations. To ease the transition from hand computations to computer analysis, SPSS is thoroughly integrated in the text. After each analysis is conducted by hand, the same example is analyzed using SPSS. That way, students can clearly see that the computer provides the same output they calculated by hand. As an added bonus, students will not need to purchase an additional manual on the use of SPSS; every relevant aspect is covered in the current textbook, from data entry to output. </p> <p><b> <i>Topics and Organization</i> </b></p> <p> This text covers statistics essential to students in the social sciences. I have chosen a slightly unusual chapter organization, with correlation and regression analyses found under <i>Inferential Statistics.</i> Traditionally, these analyses are discussed early in the course as descriptive statistics, and students never hear of <i>p</i>-values or significant effects. When I taught correlation and regression as descriptive statistics, it was always awkward for me to try to revisit them at the end of the term to let students know these analyses could actually be inferential statistics. I also wanted to avoid putting correlation and regression in the middle of z-scores because the arrangement breaks up the natural flow of discussion from descriptive to inferential statistics. </p> <p> The first part of the text, INTRODUCTION, welcomes the student, defines many research terms, and introduces math. Chapter 1 shows students that calculations for this course are not difficult; math is simply a tool we use to make sense of data and hopefully learn something new about behavior. </p> <p> The second part, DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, introduces in Chapter 2 classifications of variables, simple frequency tables and graphs, and shapes of distributions. In Chapters 3 and 4, measures of central tendency and variability are explained in detail using examples, and SPSS output is provided where appropriate. In Chapter 5, descriptive z-scores are introduced, and simple frequency distributions are revisited. </p> <p> Part III, INFERENTIAL STATISTICS: EXPERIMENTS AND QUASIEXPERIMENTS covers probability, hypothesis testing, <i>t</i>-tests, and ANOVAs by hand and using SPSS. In Chapter 6, probability and inferential z-scores flow naturally from the Chapter 5 topic of descriptive z-scores. Chapter 7 then relies on inferential z-scores to introduce the logic of hypothesis testing. Chapter 8 takes one more step, beginning with the single-sample <i>t</i>-test and moving through the dependent-samples t-test, then to the independent-samples t-test. The one-way, between-groups ANOVA in Chapter 9 is a logical extension of the independent-samples <i>t</i>-test. A significant ANOVA is followed by post hoc testing. Chapter 10 covers the two-way, between-groups ANOVA and post hoc testing of main effects and the interaction. Within this part of the text, I point out that we have true experiments only when participants are manipulated; without manipulation, we only know if variables are related. This point is illustrated by several Application Items in which a quasi-IV (e.g., gender) is used in a study, and students much decide if causation can be established. </p> <p> The fourth section, INFERENTIAL STATISTICS: CORRELATIONAL RESEARCH, covers correlation, linear regression, and chi squared. My students generally perform well on these topics, easing their stress toward the end of the term and allowing them to get their second wind for the final exam. Just as with Part III of the book, I point out here that cause and effect can in fact be established in correlational research if one variable has been manipulated. </p> <p> The fifth section offers APPENDICES to cover additional designs students are likely to use as undergraduates. Instructors may choose to discuss the logic of the one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA as well as multiple linear regression. SPSS layout, data analysis, and output for these designs are also covered. </p> <p><b>To the Student</b></p> <p><b> <i>How to Use This Book</i> </b></p> <p> While I wrote this book, I tried to always keep in mind how I would talk with you if we were discussing statistics face to face. As a result, I hope you find the conversational style enjoyable and easy to read. For many of us, statistics can be a bit overwhelming, and I didn't want the wording to get in the way of learning the material. </p> <p> Each chapter begins with a brief overview of what is found in the chapter. It is really the theory of when and why we run certain statistics. Terms that are particularly important are in <b>bold</b> type. Next, formulas are introduced with examples rather than alone because <i>using</i> the formulas is more important than just looking at them or trying to memorize them with no application. It is useful for you to calculate statistics by hand for at least two reasons: Hand calculations offer an active role in conducting statistics that reinforces the logic behind each calculation, and later, computer output can be examined for errors. The examples calculated by hand should be of interest to most college students. In fact, many examples are based on suggestions from my own students. </p> <ul> <li>The effect of calling your parents on how much spending money they send you (Chapters 3 &amp; 4)</li> <li>Pain ratings of people who get a tattoo at either the Hepatitis Shack or the House of Maim (Chapter 5)</li> <li>Students' attitudes toward the DARE program (Chapter 9)</li> <li>The relationship between hours of sleep and grades in college (Chapter 11)</li> <li>The potential relationship between sexual orientation and creativity (Chapter 13)</li> </ul> <p> As soon as you calculate the answer to an example, you'll learn to make sense of the result and write it in plain English. After all, a statistic is not useful unless it brings us knowledge to share with the world. In fact, psychologists rely on the American Psychological Association to set guidelines for reporting results, and your instructor might ask you to review the APA-style results section in relevant chapters. </p> <p> At the end of each analysis, SPSS is offered as a way to calculate answers more quickly. SPSS, a computer program used to analyze numerous types of data, was chosen for this text based on its popularity and availability. For every analysis on SPSS, an example that was recently calculated by hand is entered into the computer. The text begins with how to enter numbers in a spreadsheet and covers which options to choose from pull-down menus as well as how to read the output. It might be useful to highlight relevant information on the output to avoid focusing on information you don't need to report. </p> <p> Because each example on SPSS will have been calculated by hand first, you will be able to check the output from SPSS for reasonable answers. For example, the text indicates that SPSS offers a way to describe a <i>sample</i> that in fact is an estimate of the <i>population.</i> This type of error will not be understood unless you first complete calculations to describe a sample by hand. Of course, computers are not thinking creatures, so we have to make sure we double-check the logic of all output based on our own experiences with hand calculations. After you feel comfortable with assessing computer output, SPSS will probably replace hand calculations as an efficient way to analyze data. This will certainly be true in later courses like research methods and when you conduct your own research in the future. </p> <p> Finally, each chapter ends with a preview of the next chapter, but this section also contains a summary of the current chapter. Reading this section carefully will give you an idea of whether or not the overall picture of the-chapter is clear. </p> <p> To further check your grasp of the material, Conceptual Items will test your memory of information found in the chapter. Next, Application Items present examples to be analyzed by hand and on SPSS. </p> <ul> <li>In Chapter 7, the possibility of an effect of exercise on self-esteem can be examined.</li> <li>In Chapter 9, you can analyze a data set of several types of punishment used to discipline children to see if some are more effective than others.</li> <li>In Chapter 10, you will have the opportunity to examine the possible effect of alcohol and provocation on aggressive behavior.</li> </ul> <p> Even if your instructor does not assign practice items, you might want to make a habit of completing them to become competent with the material before a test. Additional examples can be found in the student workbook, and the workbook also showcases research articles published by undergraduates. </p></p><h2>Sherlock Holmes: Three Tales of Intrigue</h2><p>Detective Holmes and his assistant Watson reveal a long-hidden treachery, solve the betrayal and murder of a foreign heiress, and foil the frame-up of an innocent man in the cases of &#34;The Crooked Man,&#34; &#34;The Greek Interpreter,&#34; and &#34;The Naval Treaty.&#34; Read by Edward Hardwicke.</p><p><b>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</b> (1859-1930) published his first book, <i>A Study in Scarlet,</i> in 1887. In addition to being a mystery writer and a physician, he was a whaler, an athlete, a war correspondent, and a spiritualist. Conan Doyle was knighted in 1902 for his work in a South African hospital during the Boer War.It is entirely fitting that the man who portrayed Dr. Watson on PBS's "Mystery" should perform these tales of Sherlock Holmes. After all, the stories are told by Watson. Edward Hardwicke's experience on both stage and screen is apparent as he effortlessly performs "The Crooked Man," "The Greek Interpreter," and "The Naval Treaty." His expressive and steady voice effortlessly gives Holmes an excited energy while Watson, the narrator, is more steady and deliberate.

The authors show that while not all incestuously abused children experience the classic diagnostic symptoms of trauma, virtually all do experience "relational trauma" --disruptions in the sense of safety, security, loyalty, and trust that may block connection and communication with nonoffending family members. Systematically combining individual and family sessions, the relational treatment model focuses on strengthening the child's protective relationships, mobilizing the family to help resolve the child's emotional and behavioral symptoms, and building the family's resiliency. Filled with annotated case material that illuminates the challenging treatment choices and dilemmas facing the clinician, this book offers essential guidance for anyone working with families in which incest has occurred. <br></p><p>Marcia Sheinberg, LCSW, is Director of Training and Clinical Services at the Ackerman Institute for the Family.

These six domains are the dispositional domain (traits, trait taxonomies, and personality dispositions over time), the biological domain (physiology, genetics, evolution), the intrapsychic domain (psychodynamics, motives), the cognitive/experiential domain (cognition, emotion, and the self), the social and cultural domain (social interaction, gender, and culture), and the adjustment domain (stress, coping, health, and personality disorders). This book is based on the notion that these domains of knowledge represent the organizing structure of contemporary personality psychology.</p><p></p><h2>The Sin of Abbe Mouret (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><strong>"I really don't understand how people can blame a priest so much, when he strays from the path."</strong><br><br>Serge Mouret, is an obsessively devout priest, aspiring to perfect purity and sanctity.

Lauber (How Dinosaurs Came to Be, p. 553, etc.) begins with a description of the spectacular hurricane of 1938 that slammed into Long Island, bringing with it a wall of water 40 feet high that lifted entire houses off their foundations before moving on to Rhode Island where it swamped downtown Providence. With that attention-grabbing start, accompanied by many black-and-white historic photos that emphasize the devastation, Lauber steps back for an explanation of how hurricanes are formed, studied, and named. She recounts efforts to track, predict, and alter hurricanes, and then discusses more recent storms, including Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in 1992. The full-color photos in this section show acres of palm trees flattened, buildings stripped of their walls, and a town turned to rubble. Noting that 1995, one of the busiest hurricane years of this century, may mark the beginning of a ``heavy'' cycle, Lauber discusses the implications for the more than 44 million Americans who live along the coastline and for fragile environments, such as the Florida Everglades. The book is thoroughly up-to-date, and, like its subject, quite powerful. (full-color photos, maps, diagrams, further reading, index) (Nonfiction. 8-11) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Gr. 4^-8. Accounts of natural disasters make thrilling stories. Like her Newbery Honor Book <i>Volcano</i> (1986), Lauber's full-color photo-essay combines the human drama with scientific information. Here her subject is the great whirling storms that roar out of the ocean: what makes them, how to track them, and what destruction they cause. She begins with a detailed account of one disaster that came as a terrifying surprise: the 1938 monster hurricane that ravaged Long Island and New England. Then she discusses the physics of storms and the modern development of sophisticated instruments, including weather satellites and powerful computers that can help predict the path and the strength of storms. She focuses on recent big storms, especially Hurricane Andrew in 1989, detailing the damage to human areas and also to plants and wildlife. The simple, dramatic prose communicates the rising tension and the terrifying facts ("whole houses were lifted off their foundations and smashed to pieces . . ."). Browsers will start with the clearly captioned photos of pounding seas, wrecked neighborhoods, and flattened trees. The spacious book design, with large type, thick paper, wide margins, and clear maps and diagrams, will keep them reading. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>NASB Zondervan Study Bible, Indexed</h2><p><p><strong>A Complete Resource Library at Your Fingertips</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<em>Zondervan NASB Study Bible</em>&nbsp;combines the widely respected, word-for-word New American Study Bible (NASB) with study tools that represent the best in conservative scholarship.

Her autobiographical poem <i>My Life,</i> a best-selling book of innovative American poetry, has garnered accolades and fans inside and outside academia. <i>The Language of Inquiry</i> is a comprehensive and wonderfully readable collection of her essays, and its publication promises to be an important event for American literary culture. Here, Hejinian brings together twenty essays written over a span of almost twenty-five years. Like many of the Language Poets with whom she has been associated since the mid-1970s, Hejinian turns to language as a social space, a site of both philosophical inquiry and political address.<br><br>Central to these essays are the themes of time and knowledge, consciousness and perception. Hejinian's interests cover a range of texts and figures. Prominent among them are Sir Francis Bacon and Enlightenment-era explorers; Faust and Sheherazade; Viktor Shklovsky and Russian formalism; William James, Hannah Arendt, and Martin Heidegger. But perhaps the most important literary presence in the essays is Gertrude Stein; the volume includes Hejinian's influential "Two Stein Talks," as well as two more recent essays on Stein's writings.</p><p>"Hejinian's essays are a keystone of postwar North American poetics. They are also a great pleasure to read, for Hejinian is an extraordinarily resonant stylist whose work combines the lushness of her poetry with an engaging aesthetic and philosophical inventiveness. This is writing that avoids closure in the pursuit of unfolding, multifaceted, restive thought. <i>The Language of Inquiry's</i> meditations on the possibilities of poetry create an experience in which each reader is at the center. To engage with this work is to be put in touch with oneself as if anew."&#x2015;Charles Bernstein, author of <i>My Way: Speeches and Poems</i> <br><br>"From 1975, when she wrote 'A Thought Is the Bride of What Thinking' -- the first 'essay' in this collection -- Lyn Hejinian has always regarded poetry and poetics as intimately interwoven: her poetry has sometimes been highly theoretical even as her theoretical and critical peices are nothing if not poetic. <i>The Language of Inquiry,</i> the first collection of Hejinian's essays, lectures, introductions, and meditations, constitutes, in the words of Gertrude Stein, about whom she has written so brilliantly, Hejinian's own 'composition as explanation,' culminating in her new long Steinian poem, aptly called 'Happily.' This is an exciting and deeply moving book."&#x2015;Marjorie Perloff, author of <i>Wittgenstein's Ladder</i> <br><br>"'Intelligence is romantic.' These essays, prefaces, lectures, aphorisms, portraits, and meditations, by one of America's most innovative poets, passionately explore, as did the critical writings of Gertrude Stein, Marianne Moore, and Wallace Stevens, the philosophical foundations of contemporary American culture. [For Hejinian, the process of 'theorizing is . . . a manner of vulnerable, inquisitive, worldly living . . . very closely bound to the poetic process.'] <i>The Language of Inquiry</i> brilliantly demonstrates the myriad, paradoxical ways in which philosophy and poetry are indivisible and distinct." &#x2015;Susan Howe<b>Lyn Hejinian</b> is a poet and the author of <i>Writing Is an Aid to Memory</i> (1996), <i>The Cold of Poetry</i> (1994), <i>The Cell</i> (1992), and <i>My Life</i> (1987), among other books.

As they near their destination, and the lure of Captain Flint's treasure grows ever stronger, Jim's courage and wits are tested to the full. Robert Louis Stevenson reinvented the adventure genre with <em>Treasure Island</em>, a boys' story that appeals as much to adults as to children, and whose moral ambiguities turned the Victorian universe on its head. This edition celebrates the ultimate book of pirates and high adventure, and also examines how its tale of greed, murder, treachery, and evil has acquired its classic status. The book features an informative Introduction and explanatory notes by Peter Hunt, an updated bibliography, a revised chronology, and a glossary of nautical terms. Hunt includes a Note on the Text that highlights important variants between serial and volume publication and he's added additional appendices, featuring Stevenson's short fable "The Persons of the Tale" and appendix of comparative episodes from Stevenson's sources.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The names Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins are destined to remain pieces of folklore for as long as children want to read Robert Louis Stevenson's most famous book. With it's dastardly plot and motley crew of rogues and villains, it seems unlikely that children will ever say no to this timeless classic. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Through this cultural perspective, students learn that audience members are as much a part of the mass communication process as are the media producers, technologies, and industries. This was the first, and remains the only, university-level program to make media literacy central to its approach, and given recent national and global turmoil, its emphasis on media use and democracy could not be more timely. </p><p>The new edition maintains its commitment to enhancing students&#x2019; critical thinking and media literacy skills. As in recent editions, chapters offer sections on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites that discuss the impact of these technologies specific to the medium at hand. However, Chapter 10, now titled &#x201c;The Internet and Social Media,&#x201d; has undergone a major revision designed to focus greater attention on social media as a mass communication technology in its own right. </p><p>Additionally, the new 9th edition will also feature SmartBook, the first and only adaptive reading experience, that highlights content based on what the individual student knows and doesn&#x2019;t know, and provides focused help at that moment in need through targeted learning resources (including videos, animations, and other interactivities). SmartBook&#x2019;s intuitive technology optimizes student study time by creating a personalized learning path for improved course performance.</p></p><p>Stanley Baran earned his Ph.D. in communication research at the University of Massachusetts after taking his M.A. in journalism at Pennsylvania State University.

It offers sociologists the chance to choose multiple theoretical and methodological traditions that offer a full range of important questions and ways to answer them. A long standing complaint of many sociology professors, however, is that their students seem to have difficulty moving from problem formation to a theoretical approach and then onto an appropriate research design.<br>In his provocative new book, Robert Alford proposes that the starting point for any researcher in the process and craft of inquiry should begin with an understanding of how to translate elements of his/her own history, personal experience, and issues, which can then be formulated into research questions. Alford presents three basic explanatory approaches to sociology -- multivariate, interpretive, and historical -- as well as examples of each from such luminaries as Durkheim, Goffman, Weber, Marx, and William Julius Wilson. Upon critical examination, Alford finds each of these three approaches either oversimplified or incomplete. To fill this gap, Alford proposes a tripartite approach that examines each approach through the lens of the other two and analyzes the ways these three models of explanation work and relate to one another. The text is intended to show students how research emerges from, and interacts with, theory. It is designed to help students formulate, reformulate, and pursue their own theoretically informed research, as well as provide them with the tools necessary for critically reading the research of others. Using selected examples from both classic and contemporary studies, Alford strives to illustrate the artistic, rather than formulaic, side of research design and presents several ways that research questions can be framed. He also offers a "working vocabulary" to guide novice researchers through the maze of the process. Full of direct, lucid, and informative accounts of actual research efforts, <em>The Craft of Inquiry</em> is engaging and important reading for any student interested in developing strong, effective social research skills, and in becoming a better artist of the craft of inquiry.<br></p><p>Robert R.

Norse is a marine and forest conservation biologist. His Ph.D. and postdoctoral research in the 1970s examined the ecology of blue crabs in Jamaica, Curacao, Mexico, Panama, and Columbia. Since then, he has devoted his career to incorporating conservation biology into environmental decision making as a staff member or consultant for US federal agencies, international governmental organizations, scientific professional societies, conservation organizations, and foundations. His writings include more than 50 publications on environmental policy, conservation biology, marine ecology, forest ecology, and human-caused climatic change.<br><p>YA-- South America is not the only contintent destroying its forests, as this book accurately points out. Beginning with a brief examination of virgin forests as a global issue, Norse then focuses on the last remaining U. S. ancient forests. He examines in depth the complexity of the forest biome from the largest, oldest Douglas fir to the tiniest microbe, including man's impact on this irreplacable resource. With balance and objectivity, he explains the effects of the timber industry on the ecosystem and urges that we study carefully the interdependency of all life affected by the forest, not with the intention of eliminating the logging interests, but of preserving and restoring the forest so that all its uses may be perpetuated. Students will find a wealth of factual information here. The only drawback is that the book is most effective if read cover to cover, so for researchers who are dabbling, it won't be as useful.</p><p><i> Ellen Ramsay, Amphitheater High School, Tucson, AZ</i></p><p>Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>From Critical Thinking to Argument: A Portable Guide</h2><p>A brief and affordable guide to critical thinking and crafting arguments, <em>From Critical Thinking to Argument</em> teaches the right skills to write persuasive arguments. <br><p></p></p><p><b>Sylvan Barnet</b>, professor of English and former director of writing at Tufts University, is the most prolific and consistently successful college English textbook author in the country.

The work examines important questions of American planning history. Why did city planning develop in the manner it did? What did it set out to achieve and how have those goals changed? Where did planning thrive and who were its leaders? What have been the most important ideas in planning and what is their relation to thought and social development?</p> <p> By answering these questions, this book provides a general understanding for further study of the extensive literature of planning and urban history.Donald A. Krueckeberg divides this work into three historical periods: an initial period of independent but gradually converging concepts of a planned city; a second period of national organization, experimentation, and development; and a third period of implementation of planning ideas in nearly all levels and areas of urban policymaking.</p> <p> Krueckeberg begins with revealing the origins of modern planning in the movements for sanitary reform, civic art and beautification, classical revival in civic design, and neighborhood settlements and housing reform. A second section covers the institutionalization of the profession; the rise of zoning and comprehensive planning; influential figures of the period; and the new communities program of the New Deal. The book contains case studies and focuses on the role of the planner and the effectiveness of the profession. Krueckeberg concludes with a bibliography of planning history in the United States.</p></p><p><p> <em>Donald A.

After the calculus, he takes a course in analysis and a course in algebra. Depending upon his interests (or those of his department), he takes courses in special topics. Ifhe is exposed to topology, it is usually straightforward point set topology; if he is exposed to geom� etry, it is usually classical differential geometry. The exciting revelations that there is some unity in mathematics, that fields overlap, that techniques of one field have applications in another, are denied the undergraduate. He must wait until he is well into graduate work to see interconnections, presumably because earlier he doesn&#39;t know enough. These notes are an attempt to break up this compartmentalization, at least in topology-geometry. What the student has learned in algebra and advanced calculus are used to prove some fairly deep results relating geometry, topol� ogy, and group theory. (De Rham&#39;s theorem, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for surfaces, the functorial relation of fundamental group to covering space, and surfaces of constant curvature as homogeneous spaces are the most note� worthy examples.) In the first two chapters the bare essentials of elementary point set topology are set forth with some hint ofthe subject&#39;s application to functional analysis.</p><p></p><h2>The Best of Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass, The Hunting of the Snark, A Tangled Tale, Phantasmagoria, Nonsense from Letters)</h2><p><p>Lewis Carroll spells magic!

His new book, <i>The Witching Herbs</i>, is an in-depth exploration of 13 essential plants and herbs most closely associated with witchcraft&#x2015;13 because it&#x2019;s the witching number and reflects the 13 months of the lunar calendar. The plants are poppy, clary sage, yarrow, rue, hyssop, vervain, mugwort, wormwood, datura, wild tobacco, henbane, belladonna, and mandrake.</p><p>Roth writes simply and clearly on a vast amount of esoteric information that is not easily found elsewhere and will be greeted enthusiastically by those who already have extensive experience and libraries. It is unique in that it combines mysticism with practical instructions for growing each plant, based on Roth&#x2019;s 30 years of gardening expertise. Each chapter focuses on one plant and includes information on its unique plant spirit familiar, clear how-to instructions for magical projects, and pragmatic information on growing and cultivating.</p><p>Roth writes, &#x201c;This book is a great choice for intermediate-to-advanced witches who would like to work more closely with the traditional witching herbs, especially the baneful plants with their rather difficult spirits. Working directly with spirits is one of the fundamentals of the Craft.&#x201d;</p><p><i>The Witching Herbs</i> is the essential plant-worker&#x2019;s guide. Roth is not only a successful gardener, but also a magician and scholar of the occult.

For the past 15 years, he has owned and operated Alchemy Works, an online store focused on herb magic, where he crafts and sells incense, potions, and magical oils. <i>The Witching Herbs</i> has been in the works for a decade and is eagerly anticipated. Visit him at www.haroldroth.com."Harold Roth&#x2019;s website alchemy-works.com has been a constant companion and guide for me over the years. What made me come back were not only the well-researched tables of planetary correspondences, but also the many interesting and neatly structured info articles spiced up with Harold&#x2019;s personal insights on the spiritual nature of magical herbs and incense ingredients and what could be done with them. When I research the magical properties of a plant or resin, Harold Roth is an author I rely on, as he provides substantiated and well informed advice, founded on decades of practical experience in Kabbalah, Hermeticism, alchemy, European witchcraft, Native American medicine, Afro-American folk-magical traditions, and, of course, gardening. What is truly unique about Harold is that his approach is literally rooted in the same ground that the plants grow on, as well as his ability to bring us closer to them, not only in word but also through beautifully done illustrations. And as if this would not be enough, we are given plenty of recipes to try by ourselves. To say that Harold&#x2019;s first book, <i>The Witching Herbs</i>, is highly anticipated is an understatement.

Harold Roth&#x2019;s book, <i>The Witching Herbs</i>, is for anyone ready to put down the plastic bags of dried herbs and go deep into the mystery and power of the whole plant. Rather than going wide with hundreds of herbs, he delves deep into 13 witching herbs and in so doing gives us not only a master&#x2019;s comprehension of these, but the tools to understand any other plant magic. This book is the best thing to happen to wortcunning this century." &#x2015;<b>Jason Miller</b>, author of <i>Financial Sorcery</i> and <i>The Sorcerers Secrets</i>, and creator of The Strategic Sorcery Course<br><br>"Connecting with plant spirits by growing magical plants yourself is the ultimate in herbal magic, according to this debut. Roth leans heavily on a modernized version of the ancient Doctrine of Signatures that teaches practitioners to look to a plant&#x2019;s morphology to understand its use, adding clues from growth patterns, traditional medicine, and chemistry as well as from traditional lore and personal gnosis. Though there are extended planting and care notes for every plant, Roth makes his picks according to their reputation in traditional European witchcraft rather than ease of cultivation. He includes several of the baneful herbs he calls the &#x201c;Weird Sisters&#x201d;&#x2015;datura, mandrake, belladonna, and henbane&#x2015;but, although some traditional recipes are included in the practice section, Roth never recommends consumption, stating that practitioners should pursue them &#x201c;through direct spiritual contact&#x201d; rather than by stepping onto the rickety bridge of alkaloid consumption. Sections on &#x201c;practice&#x201d; included in each entry add up to a primer in herbal magic methods, so readers learn how to make tinctures with clary sage, dry and powder herbs with yarrow, and unguents with vervain. Roth views the herb magician as spiritual seeker rather than rules-bound potion maker, an attitude that can be unfortunately rare in more encyclopedic botanical magic guidebooks." --<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b> (Mar. 2017)<br><br>"Harold Roth&#x2019;s <i>The Witching Herbs</i> offers an original perspective on the magical dimension of plants, rooted not in the repetition of occult texts but in the soil itself, as accessed by hands, head, and heart." &#x2015;<b>Daniel A.

Roth roots his work in the doctrine of signatures, mediated by the patient dedication to the plant itself, and, in this, he has manifested a work softly born by the whispers of the 13 plants themselves, flanked with folklore, myths, and the frustrating and rewarding poetry of practice. It is a book easy to recommend, a delight to read, a book that deserves a place not only on the bookshelf, but as a companion in the garden of witching herbs." &#x2015;<b>Nicholaj de Mattos Frisvold</b>, author of <i>Craft of the Untamed, Palo Mayombe: The Garden of Blood and Bones</i>, and <i>Exu and the Quimbanda of Night and Fire</i></p><h2>Computer Systems</h2><p>Completely revised and updated, Computer Systems, Fourth Edition offers a clear, detailed, step-by-step introduction to the central concepts in computer organization, assembly language, and computer architecture.

Chief of the Nazi Criminal Police, the SS Security Service, and the Gestapo, ruthless overlord of Nazi-occupied Bohemia and Moravia, and leading planner of the "Final Solution," Heydrich played a central role in Hitler's Germany. He shouldered a major share of responsibility for some of the worst Nazi atrocities, and up to his assassination in Prague in 1942, he was widely seen as one of the most dangerous men in Nazi Germany. Yet Heydrich has received remarkably modest attention in the extensive literature of the Third Reich.</p><p>Robert Gerwarth weaves together little-known stories of Heydrich's private life with his deeds as head of the Nazi Reich Security Main Office. Fully exploring Heydrich's progression from a privileged middle-class youth to a rapacious mass murderer, Gerwarth sheds new light on the complexity of Heydrich's adult character, his motivations, the incremental steps that led to unimaginable atrocities, and the consequences of his murderous efforts toward re-creating the entire ethnic makeup of Europe.</p></p><p><b>Robert Gerwarth</b> is professor of modern history at University College Dublin and director of UCD&#x2019;s Centre for War Studies.&#x201c;This admirable biography makes plausible what actually happened and makes human what we might prefer to dismiss as monstrous.&#x201d;&#x2014;Timothy Snyder, <i>Wall Street Journal</i> (Timothy Snyder <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[A] probing biography...Gerwarth&#x2019;s fine study shows in chilling detail how genocide emerged from the practicalities of implementing a demented belief system.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Supremely enlightening.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jacob Heilbrunn, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> (Jacob Heilbrunn <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[M]eticulously takes us inside the Third Reich, face to face with the Nazi hero, revealing as few texts do how the bureaucracy of evil worked.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Gerwarth&#x2019;s approach is subtle, painstaking and psychologically acute; it convincingly demonstrates that the historian&#x2019;s tool of 'cold empathy' best clarifies the enduring question of what brings forth monsters.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roy Foster, <i>Times Literary Supplement (Books of the Year)</i> (Roy Foster <i>Times Literary Supplement (Books of the Year)</i> 2011-12-02)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Hitler&#x2019;s Hangman: The Life of Heydrich</i> by Robert Gerwarth is superb on the making of evil.&#x201d;&#x2014;Frank Dikotter, <i>The Daily Telegraph (Books of the Year)</i> (Frank Dikotter <i>The Daily Telegraph (Books of the Year)</i> 2011-11-19)<br><br>&#x201c;Robert Gerwarth&#x2019;s <i>Hitler&#x2019;s Hangman: The Life of Heydrich</i> is the outstanding definitive scholarly and heartbreakingly horrible biography of the repellent mastermind of the Holocaust.&#x201d;&#x2014;Simon Sebag Montefiore, <i>BBC History Magazine (Books of the Year)</i> (Simon Sebag Montefiore <i>BBC History Magazine (Books of the Year)</i> 2011-12-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Gerwarth...offers a first rate biography of one of history&#x2019;s most notorious villains.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Deseret News</i> (<i>Deseret News</i>)<br><br>"Gerwarth's mastery of primary sources and relevant secondary literature is impressive, and his integration of the most recent scholarship and historiographical perspectives on the Nazi dictatorship and the Holocaust make this fine biography even more compelling.

Escape&#x2014;in the form of stowing away on a ship&#x2014;only deepens his exposure to the squalor and brutality that men are capable of, and when he arrives in Alexandria he learns there are some things that one can't run away from. Narrated in unflinching language that is both visceral and acute in its observational power, <i>Boy</i> is a shocking book that stays in the mind long after it is read. Unfairly neglected during his lifetime, only recently has this original, uncompromising novelist started to be reappraised as among the finest novelists writing in English in the 20th century.</p><p><b>James Hanley</b> was born in Liverpool to Irish immigrants and left school at an early age to become a sailor.

But how and why did archaeology emerge as such a pervasive force there? How can the practices of archaeology help answer those questions? In this stirring book, Nadia Abu El-Haj addresses these questions and specifies for the first time the relationship between national ideology, colonial settlement, and the production of historical knowledge. She analyzes particular instances of history, artifacts, and landscapes in the making to show how archaeology helped not only to legitimize cultural and political visions but, far more powerfully, to reshape them. Moreover, she places Israeli archaeology in the context of the broader discipline to determine what unites the field across its disparate local traditions and locations.<br> <br> Boldly uncovering an Israel in which science and politics are mutually constituted, this book shows the ongoing role that archaeology plays in defining the past, present, and future of Palestine and Israel.</p></p><p>In this incisive book, Nadia Abu El-Haj demonstrates the role that archaeology has played in Israeli society, examining how it emerged as a pervasive force that has shaped the region&#39;s social and political imaginations and has inspired violently contested territorial and national-cultural struggles. Based on archival research and ethnographic work among archaeologists, tour guides, and politicians, she presents the first critical account of Israeli archaeological practice while tracing the dynamic relationships among science, colonization, nation-state building, and territorial expansion.<b>Nadia Abu El-Haj</b> is an assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>Teen to Teen: 365 Daily Devotions by Teen Guys for Teen Guys</h2><p>What more encouraging way to gain perspective than by talking to someone who has been there, especially when that someone is one of your peers.<br><br> Written expressly for teens by teens, this unique 365 day devotional is filled with personal experiences that are relatable and heart-felt.<br><br> In addition to learning teen to teen how to deal with difficult issues and maneuver the often trying path to adulthood, each devotion leads teens to move into a deeper relationship with Christ as they recognize that He is the answer to life's problems and strife.

By the author of The Holes in Your Nose.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: JapanesePreSchool-Grade 2?Most children are curious about scabs, for many of them have a scab somewhere on their bodies for most of their childhood. This Japanese import explores that fascination and explains how and why scabs form. Children with orange skin discuss picking them, eating them ("YUCK!"), and wonder what they are made of. "Is it hardened blood?" Could it be the "poop of a sore?" There is no indication which words are spoken by what character. The crudely drawn art and the words are helter-skelter on the pages, giving a messy appearance. However, even though the pictures are unattractive, the diagrams are well labeled and easy to understand and the clear, conversational text explains the process very well.?Martha Gordon, formerly at South Salem Library, NY<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Charles Dickens: Great Expectations / Hard Times / A Christmas Carol / A Tale of Two Cities (Greenwich Unabridged Library Classics)</h2><p>Color illus. throughout. 4 1/2 x 7.

Through such works as &#34;Totality and Infinity&#34; and &#34;Otherwise than Being&#34;, he has exerted a profound influence on twentieth-century continental philosophy, providing inspiration for Derrida, Lyotard, Blanchot and Irigaray. &#34;The Levinas Reader&#34; collects, often for the first time in English, essays by Levinas encompassing every aspect of his thought: the early phenomenological studies written under the guidance and inspiration of Husserl and Heidegger; the fully developed ethical critique of such totalizing philosophies; the pioneering texts on the moral dimension to aesthetics; the rich and subtle readings of the Talmud which are an exemplary model of an ethical, transcendental philosophy at work; the admirable meditations on current political issues. Sean Hand&#39;s introduction gives a complete overview of Levinas&#39;s work and situates each chapter within his general contribution to phenomenology, aesthetics, religion, politics and, above all, ethics. Each essay has been prefaced with a brief introduction presenting the basic issues and the necessary background, and suggesting ways to study the text further.</p><p><b>Sean Hand</b> was the translator for a number of pieces in Moi: "The Kristeva Reader".Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>80X86 IBM PC and Compatible Computers: Assembly Language, Design, and Interfacing</h2><p><p><b></b> Praised by experts for its clarity and topical breadth, this visually appealing, one-stop source on PCs uses an easy-to-understand, step-by-step approach to teaching the fundamentals of 80x86 assembly language programming and PC architecture.

The recent upsurge in the use of Bayesian methods in applied statistical analysis highlights the need to expose students early on to the Bayes theorem, its advantages, and its applications. Based on the author&#x2019;s successful courses, Introduction to Bayesian Statistics introduces statistics from a Bayesian perspective in a way that is understandable to readers with a reasonable mathematics background. <p>Covering most of the same ground found in a typical statistics book&#x2013;but from a Bayesian perspective&#x2013;Introduction to Bayesian Statistics offers thorough, clearly-explained discussions of:</p> <ul> <li>Scientific data gathering, including the use of random sampling methods and randomized experiments to make inferences on cause-effect relationships</li> <li>The rules of probability, including joint, marginal, and conditional probability</li> <li>Discrete and continuous random variables</li> <li>Bayesian inferences for means and proportions compared with the corresponding frequentist ones</li> <li>The simple linear regression model analyzed in a Bayesian manner</li> </ul> <p>To assist in the understanding of Bayesian statistics, this introduction provides readers with exercises (with selected answers); summaries of main points from each chapter; a calculus refresher, and a summary on the use of statistical tables; and R functions and Minitab macros for Bayesian analysis and Monte Carlo simulations (downloadable from the associated Web site)</p></p><p><b>WILLIAM M.

Most background sections at the end of each chapter have been updated to take account of important recent research results, the references have been greatly expanded, and more advanced exercises have been added which have been used successfully in teaching the course.<br> <br> Part II, The Prolog Language, has been modified to be compatible with the new Prolog standard, and the chapter on program development has been significantly altered: the predicates defined have been moved to more appropriate chapters, the section on efficiency has been moved to the considerably expanded chapter on cuts and negation, and a new section has been added on stepwise enhancement�&#x20ac;&#x201d;a systematic way of constructing Prolog programs developed by Leon Sterling.<br> <br> All but one of the chapters in Part III, Advanced Prolog Programming Techniques, have been substantially changed, with some major rearrangements.

Michael J. Seth&#x2019;s thorough chronological narrative equally emphasizes social, cultural, and political history. Students will be especially drawn to descriptions of everyday life for both elite and nonelite members of society during various historical periods. The book emphasizes how Korean history can be understood as part of an interactive sphere that includes three basic areas: China, Japan, and the Manchurian/Central Asian region. Throughout, Seth draws comparisons between developments in Korea and those in neighboring regions. All readers looking for a balanced, knowledgeable history will be richly rewarded with this clear and cogent book.</p><p>Michael J. Seth is professor of history at James Madison University.The second edition of Korea expert Seth&#x2019;s two-volume work provides an extremely dense history of Korea from antiquity to the present, focusing on economic and state or national formation. The first volume, subtitled From Antiquity through the Late Nineteenth Century, includes more information on art, literature, religion, and philosophy than the second volume, subtitled From the Late Nineteenth Century to the Present, but both would have benefited from illustrations beyond the maps provided before the introductions, particularly in chapters 7 and 8 of the first volume. Whether exploring the rise and influence of Buddhism and Confucianism on the Korean people as they developed a homogeneous society or illuminating the distinctions between the arbitrarily divided peninsula into the radically divergent &#x2018;lifestyles and living standards&#x2019; separating North and South Korea, Seth provides a tremendous amount of material within a few succinct paragraphs. The title a &#x2018;concise history&#x2019; is quite apt, and Seth&#x2019;s writing style and use of sources ensures the work a prominent place within the historiography, particularly for undergraduates. Both volumes benefit from revisions from the first edition that reflect the rapid development of Korean historical understanding in the West along with chapter essays on Korea in global perspective, which focus on specific issues of economic development: state formation and ideology in its many forms, foreign policy from antiquity to the present in East Asia, imperialism and colonialism, education and meritocracy, and warfare. Seth also includes a selection of primary source extracts relating to ideas or individuals discussed at the end of each chapter. Excellent maps in both volumes, appendixes providing information on Romanization, a glossary of Korean words, and an annotated select bibliography. Good use of chapter notes.<br><br>Summing Up: Highly recommended. All undergraduate and graduate collections. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>The first edition of Michael Seth's A History of Korea became a benchmark for an overview of Korean history in English. Now bigger and better, it promises to become a standard for Korean history in any language. (John Lie, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br>In this highly readable text, Michael Seth scores a number of important achievements. He explains the transitions in Korean history in a clear manner and proposes answers to questions that historians have long grappled with. In updating his earlier work, Seth cites the most recent research, adds a section on Korea from a global perspective, and also provides a primary source entry for each chapter, enabling students to look at original documents. This is an excellent text that includes all the essential information any undergraduate would need. (Edward Shultz, emeritus, University of Hawaii at Manoa)<br><br>Michael Seth's book provides a clear and accessible survey of Korean history, deftly covering all of the key topics that should be included in a course on the subject. I would highly recommend it to anybody looking to gain a stronger understanding of the historical development of Korea. (Gregg A.

(Historians at Work)</h2><p>During World War II, over 120,000 Japanese Americans were removed and confined for four years in sixteen camps located throughout the western half of the United States. Yet the internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps remains a largely unknown episode of World War II history. Indeed, many of the internees themselves do not wish to speak of it, even to their own family members. In these selections, Alice Yang Murray invites students to investigate this event and to review and challenge the conventional interpretations of its significance. The selections explore the U.S. government&#39;s role in planning and carrying out the removal and internment of thousands of citizens, resident aliens, and foreign nationals, and the ways in which Japanese Americans coped with or resisted their removal and incarceration.</p><p><b>ALICE YANG MURRAY</b> is assistant professor of history at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She has published articles on the history of the internment, oral history, and the history of Asian American women. She is currently completing a manuscript entitled <i>Better Americans in a Greater America: Japanese American Internment, Redress, and Historical Memory</i>.&#39;I like the premise of Historians at Work.

Her nose is millimeters from my face, her whiskers grazing my lips. She suddenly sneezes explosively, an exclamation point on her greeting. I open my eyes and she is gazing at me, smiling, panting a hello.<br> <br>Go look at a dog. Go on, look&#x2014;maybe at one lying near you right now, curled around his folded legs on a dog bed, or sprawled on his side on the floor. Take a good look. And now forget everything you know about this or any other dog.<br> <br>Okay, I admit it&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t really forget all that you know. I don&#x2019;t expect you to forget your dog&#x2019;s name or his favorite food. But humor me and try. We are going to be looking at dogs through the lens of science, and science asks us to set aside what we think we already know and focus instead on what we can prove.<br> <br>It will turn out that some of what we thought all along about our dogs is true, and other things that appear obvious are more doubtful than anyone knew. And when we try looking from a new point of view&#x2014;from the point of view of dogs themselves&#x2014;new ideas may arise in our minds. So the best way to begin understanding dogs is by forgetting what we think we already know.<br> <br>The first thing to do is to stop thinking of your dog as if he is a human being.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s easy to make this mistake. We think about our dogs as if they are people, because being people is something that we easily understand. Of course, we say, dogs love and long for things; of course they dream and think. We believe dogs know and understand us, feel bored, get jealous, and get depressed. We believe our dogs do all these things because we do all these things. But we&#x2019;ll come to a better understanding of dogs if we start with what dogs&#x2014;not people&#x2014;can actually feel, know, and understand.<br> <br>We understand human experiences the best. So it&#x2019;s simplest for us to explain our dogs by imagining that their experiences are just like ours. If a person&#x2019;s eyes look mournful and she sighs loudly, we can figure out that she is sad, maybe even depressed. If your dog does the same thing, is it safe to say that he is sad? Depressed?<br> <br>Sometimes we&#x2019;re right when we assume that dogs have feelings and reactions that match ours. Maybe our dogs really are depressed. Maybe sometimes they&#x2019;re also jealous, curious, or extremely interested in having a peanut butter sandwich for lunch. But maybe they&#x2019;re not.<br> <br>If we see an animal&#x2019;s mouth turn up at the corners, we might think that the animal is happy. But a dolphin isn&#x2019;t happy just because its mouth turns up&#x2014;its mouth is made that way. A chimpanzee who shows his teeth in a grin is actually making a sign of fear and submission. He&#x2019;s about as far from happy as a chimpanzee gets.<br> <br>A human who raises her eyebrows is usually surprised. A capuchin monkey who does the same thing is not surprised&#x2014;he&#x2019;s signaling to nearby monkeys that he is friendly. A baboon who raises his eyebrows, however, is making a deliberate threat. (So be careful when raising your eyebrows at a monkey.)<br> <br>If we think only in terms of what humans want or do or like, we can end up missing or ignoring things animals do when they are simply being animals.<br> TAKE MY RAINCOAT, PLEASE<p></p> <br>For instance, many dog owners have noticed that their dogs resist going outside when it&#x2019;s raining. From this observation, they come to a conclusion: My dog does not like rain.<br> <br>So the owner buys the dog a raincoat.<br> <br>My dog does not like rain. What does this mean? Does it mean that the dog dislikes getting rain on his body? It seems likely. Most humans, after all, do not like getting wet in the rain. But does that make the same thing true for dogs? We can look at the dog himself for evidence. The dog can&#x2019;t speak up to say how he feels about the rain, so we must look at what the dog does.<br> <br>Is the dog excited and wagging when you get the raincoat out? This seems to suggest that the conclusion is true&#x2014;the dog does not like rain and appreciates the raincoat because it keeps the rain off his fur. But there&#x2019;s another possible explanation for this behavior: Maybe the dog is simply excited because he knows the raincoat means that he is (finally!) going for a walk.<br> <br>More evidence is needed. Does the dog flee from the raincoat? Curl his tail under his body and duck his head? This suggests that the conclusion is not true: The dog doesn&#x2019;t like the raincoat.<br> <br>What about how the dog behaves when his fur is actually wet with rain? Does he look bedraggled? Does he shake the water off excitedly? What does this mean? It&#x2019;s hard to be sure. The dog&#x2019;s behavior is not giving us a clear answer here. Does he mind the rain or doesn&#x2019;t he? Does he need a raincoat or not?<br> <br>We need some more clues, so we could take a look at some animals closely related to dogs&#x2014;wolves. Both dogs and wolves, obviously, have their own coats on all the time. One coat is enough; when it rains, wolves may seek shelter, but they don&#x2019;t try to cover up with, say, leaves or branches. This suggests that dogs, too&#x2014;except those with little or no fur&#x2014;do not need an extra coat to protect them from the rain.<br> <br>And a raincoat is something more than protection from falling water. A raincoat is a covering. It feels snug on your body. It presses on the back, chest, and sometimes the head of a dog who is wearing it. There are times when wolves get pressed upon the back or the head&#x2014;when they are being scolded or &#x201c;dominated&#x201d; by another wolf.<br> <br>A &#x201c;dominant&#x201d; animal is one who has authority over another, &#x201c;submissive,&#x201d; animal. A dominant wolf is usually older, stronger, and larger than a submissive wolf. Sometimes, a wolf who is trying to show his dominance will pin another wolf by the snout, or actually stand over the other wolf. The wolf underneath will feel the pressure of the wolf&#x2019;s body on top of him. The pressure of a raincoat on a dog&#x2019;s back might feel similar.<br> <br>For a person, wearing a raincoat feels like being protected from water in the air. For a dog, wearing a raincoat might feel like being told that another, stronger animal is nearby.<br> <br>Is this the best interpretation of the dog&#x2019;s behavior? Looking at the evidence will tell us. Most dogs, when they are getting put into a raincoat, freeze in place. (You might see the same behavior when a dog who is getting a bath stops struggling when his fur gets heavy with water or a heavy towel is placed over him.) This is what a submissive wolf does&#x2014;hold still to show he accepts the other animal&#x2019;s authority.<br> <br>Ultimately, we can correctly conclude that a dog wearing a coat may go out peaceably into the rain, but it is not because he hates the rain or he likes the raincoat. It is because the coat makes him feel that someone else is in control.<br> <br>If we think about what human beings are like&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t like being wet and we want to protect our bodies from water&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll come to the wrong conclusion about dogs and raincoats. If we look at what dogs (and their close relatives, wolves) actually do, then we&#x2019;ll come to a conclusion that is more likely to be true.<br> AN ANIMAL&#x2019;S WORLD AND HIS UMWELT<p></p> <br>In most cases, it is simple to start thinking of the dog as a dog and not as a small, furry human. All you have to do is to ask the dog what he wants. Then you must learn to translate his answer.<br> <br>The first tool you&#x2019;ll need in getting that answer is this: understanding the point of view of the dog.<br> <br>Each dog&#x2014;each animal&#x2014;has a point of view. Even more, each animal has its own world. It is a world made up of all the things the animals can see, smell, hear, or sense in some other way. It is a world made up of all the things that matter to the animal, that could help it or harm it, that are worth its notice or important for its life.<br> <br>One scientist coined a word for it: umwelt, or &#x201c;self-world.&#x201d; (You say it OOM-velt.) A creature&#x2019;s umwelt is made up of all the things that matter to that creature&#x2014;all the things it notices or needs, can eat or sleep on or climb or fight with or run away from.<br> <br>For example, consider the tick.<br> <br>You probably haven&#x2019;t thought much about them. Maybe you&#x2019;ve found one or two of these pests on your dog. It would be surprising if you had taken the time to consider what the world of a tick is like.<br> <br>But take that time now.<br> <br>Soon after hatching, a young tick climbs to a high perch&#x2014;say, a blade of grass. Here&#x2019;s where things get interesting. Of all the sights, sounds, and smells in the world, the adult tick is waiting for just one. It is not looking around; ticks are blind. Sounds don&#x2019;t interest it. Only one thing will get a reaction from that tick: a whiff of butyric acid, a chemical given off by all warm-blooded creatures (like us&#x2014;and dogs). We can sometimes smell it in sweat.<br> <br>The tick might wait for that smell for a day, a month, or even up to a dozen years. Once it smells that precise odor, it drops off its perch. The tick&#x2019;s body is sensitive to warmth, and now it begins searching for a source of warmth and scurrying toward it. If the tick is lucky, it will reach the warm, sweaty being it has sensed nearby, climb aboard, and drink a meal of blood. After eating once, it drops off, lays eggs, and dies.<br> <br>The point of all this is that the tick&#x2019;s world, its umwelt, is different from ours in astonishing ways. All that matters to the tick is smell and warmth, and so those two things are what it notices. The wind that whisks through the grass? Doesn&#x2019;t matter to the tick. The sounds of a child&#x2019;s birthday party? The tick doesn&#x2019;t care. The delicious crumbs of cake dropped on the ground? The tick doesn&#x2019;t notice that they are there.<br> <br>The tick has four simple jobs&#x2014;it mates, waits, drops, and feeds. So the tick&#x2019;s universe is divided into things that help it do these jobs, and things that do not matter. Its umwelt is made up of ticks and non-ticks, things it can climb on and things it cannot climb on, surfaces it might or might not drop onto, and things that it may or may not want to eat. Nothing else matters to the tick. Nothing else is part of its umwelt.<br> <br>We humans have an umwelt too. In our umwelt we pay a lot of attention to where other people are and to what they are saying. (A tick, on the other hand, could not care less about a beautiful song or funny joke.) We see and hear the things that reach our eyes and ears, and we can smell strong odors that are right in front of our noses. There are other things going on all around us&#x2014;the cry of a bat, too high-pitched for our ears to hear, or the smell of what a passerby had for dinner last night&#x2014;but because they are not part of our umwelt, they mean nothing to us.<br> <br>The same object might exist in several creatures&#x2019; world, but it will mean different things to each. To a human being, a rose is a certain kind of flower, a romantic gift, or a thing of beauty. To a beetle, a rose might be an entire world, with places to hide, hunt, or lay eggs. To an elephant, a rose might be a thorn barely noticeable as it is crushed underfoot.<br> <br>And to a dog? In a dog&#x2019;s umwelt, a rose is not a beautiful object or an entire world. A rose is just one part of all the plants that surround the dog. It is not particularly notable unless it has been urinated on by another dog, stepped on by another animal, or handled by the dog&#x2019;s owner. Then the rose becomes a thing of vivid interest, and it matters more to the dog than even the most beautiful rose might matter to us.<br> <br>To understand a dog, we must do our best to enter his umwelt, to experience the world as a dog sees, hears, and (most importantly) smells it. Let&#x2019;s try it now.<br> <br>Try smelling every object that you come across in the space of an afternoon.<br> <br>Try listening to all the sounds around you now, the ones that you normally tune out. Can you hear a fan behind you, a beeping truck backing up in the street outside, the murmurs of far-off voices, someone nearby shifting in a chair, your own heart beating, a gulp as you swallow? If you could hear like a dog, you might notice these things plus a pen scratching on paper, the sound of a plant stretching as it grows, the cries of the insects that are always around us.<br> <br>Drop down on the floor. Spending a bit of time at the height of your dog is surprising. What does the world look like down there? What do you notice? What becomes important to you?<br> <br>Of course, even if you are down on your hands and knees, you are not seeing the objects in a room exactly as a dog sees them. A dog looking around a room does not think he is surrounded by human things; he sees dog things. Some dog things are the same as human things. Some are different.<br> <br>A person sees a chair as a thing-to-be-sat-upon. A dog might see it that way too. The dog also sees the sofa, a pile of pillows, and the lap of a person on the floor as things-to-be-sat-upon. But he probably doesn&#x2019;t see a stool that way, although a person might. To a dog, a stool is more like an-obstacle-in-the-way.<br> <br>A dog and a person are both likely to see a peanut butter sandwich as something-to-be-eaten. But to a dog, things-that-can-be-eaten is a wider category than it is to a person. Garbage isn&#x2019;t on a human list of menu items, but it is on a dog&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Dogs have categories of their own&#x2014;things-that-are-good-to-roll-in, for example. And dogs don&#x2019;t notice or care about many items that matter to humans&#x2014;forks, knives, hammers, pushpins, fans, clocks, and so on. A dog cannot do anything to or with a clock, so the clock isn&#x2019;t part of the dog&#x2019;s umwelt. A dog cannot hammer a nail, so the dog doesn&#x2019;t care about the hammer&#x2014;unless he notices the wooden handle and puts the hammer in the category of things-that-can-be-chewed.<br> <br>A clash of umwelts can happen when a dog and a human see the same object in different ways. For instance, many dog owners insist that the dog is never to lie on the bed. Perhaps the owner will go out and purchase a large pillow, labeled a &#x201c;dog bed.&#x201d; The dog will be encouraged to lie on this special bed, the non-forbidden bed. The dog will do so, sometimes reluctantly. And the dog owner feels successful: no dog on the bed!<br> <br>Or is there? Many days I returned home to find a warm, rumpled pile of sheets on my bed and a wagging dog greeting me at the door.<br> <br>The reason this happens becomes clear when we think about how a dog&#x2019;s world is different from a human&#x2019;s world. To a human, the difference between the dog bed and the human bed is obvious. The dog bed is low on the floor; the human bed is higher. The dog bed has a plain covering; the human bed has sheets and pillows. The dog bed is for dogs; the human bed is for humans. We would never be tempted to curl up on the dog bed. We expect the dog to feel the same way about the human bed.<br> <br>What about the dog? Dogs don&#x2019;t generally see beds as special places for sleeping at all. They sleep and rest where they can, and prefer places that allow them to stretch out or curl up, where the temperature feels good, where there are other members of their family nearby, and where they feel safe. Any flattish surface in your home probably meets a dog&#x2019;s definition of a decent place to sleep.<br> <br>So does a dog see the same clear difference between the dog bed and the human bed that we do? Probably not. Here&#x2019;s what your dog is likely to notice about your bed: It smells like you. It&#x2019;s a place where you relax, where you leave clothes, where you might drop crumbs. All those things make it a wonderful place to sleep. Better than the dog bed by far.<br> <br><br> ASKING DOGS<p></p> <br>Beginning to und...</p><h2>Essentials of Human Communication</h2><p>This top-selling book presents the essential skills of interpersonal, small group, and public communication, emphasizing the areas of human communication skills, cultural awareness, listening, critical thinking, ethics, power and empowerment, and computer-mediated communication.

Those who enjoy spicy Latin American fare will be happy to learn that they can still eat their favorite delicacies by modifying the recipes. Fuste, a dietician who runs a nutrition program for seniors, presents more than 150 recipes for such traditional dishes as empanadas, salsas, paella, tamales, meats and seafood, beverages, and desserts. By grilling or baking instead of frying, using low-fat dairy products, and reducing the amount of sugar and salt, cooks can make healthy meals while retaining traditional flavors. The bilingual text has English and Spanish versions on facing pages, and the author provides nutritional and diabetic exchange information for all recipes. She also includes a glossary, shopping list, chili rating chart (in terms of hotness), a resource list, and guidelines for a walking program. There are other interesting diabetic cookbooks, such as Chris Smith's Cooking with the Diabetic Chef, but none specifically for Latin foods.

But how was the vast territory of the empire controlled? Did the demands of central government stimulate economic growth or endanger survival? What forces of cohesion operated to balance the social and economic inequalities and high mortality rates? How did the official religion react in the face of the diffusion of alien cults and the emergence of Christianity?<br><br> These are some of the many questions posed here, in the new, expanded edition of Garnsey and Saller's pathbreaking account of the economy, society, and culture of the Roman Empire. This second edition includes a new introduction that explores the consequences for government and the governing classes of the replacement of the Republic by the rule of emperors. Addenda to the original chapters offer up-to-date discussions of issues and point to new evidence and approaches that have enlivened the study of Roman history in recent decades. A completely new chapter assesses how far Rome&#x2019;s subjects resisted her hegemony. The bibliography has also been thoroughly updated, and a new color plate section has been added.</p><p>&#x201c;Brilliantly conceived by two of the greatest living authorities on ancient Rome and an instant classic when it first appeared, this magisterial work has been generously expanded and updated to incorporate the latest scholarship.

The bibliographical addenda are mines of information: sure guides to the best of recent scholarship on every aspect of the empire covered by the authors.

With 300 full-color and duotone illustrations, the full range of Paik&#39;s achievement is represented - from his early 1960s performance pieces through his videotapes, installations, megatrons, and celebrated &#34;robot&#34; portraits. The volume is the first to represent Paik&#39;s recent laser-projection installations in the rotunda of Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. John G. Hanhardt provides an overview of the artist&#39;s career while focusing on his important place in the history of the moving image. The volume includes a selected exhibition and performance history as well as a selected bibliography.</p><p>Holding a magnet to the face of a TV screen distorts the picture in strange and wonderful ways. Distorting or changing our ideas about the way television or video should look or work is the central theme of Nam June Paik!s art. Educated as a modernist musician in Japan and Europe, he arrived in New York in 1964 to participate in the radical Fluxus art movement then challenging the limits of conventional artistic theory. From a musical and performance background he proceeded to experiment with film and video, often producing spectacular installations of video monitors built into indoor or outdoor sculptures. Piling up antique TVs into robots or building wall maps of the Unites States using neon outlines around dozens of video monitors, Paik has created a vivid metaphor of the late 20th century. Written to accompany the current exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum, this catalog presents an excellent overview of Paik!s involvement with the New York artworld of the Sixties, of his increasing fame as a designer of freestanding video sculpture, and of the numerous video works. This is the best single summation of Paik available in book format."David McClelland, Philadelphia <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Introduction to Functional Programming (Prentice Hall International Series in Computing Science)</h2><p>Introduction to Functional Programming.

The book aims to help clinicians improve the lives of their patients--and patients to improve their own lives--by identifying these secrets and taking action in ways that can work immediately, closing the science-to-practice gap. In addition to mental health and primary care clinicians, patients and their families will find the books many stories, clinical examples and cultural references fascinating and illuminating. The books four foundational truths, all hiding in plain sight and all eminently actionable, are - Behavior serves a purpose. The search for meaning and the identification and communication value of a behavior are too often overlooked aspects of mental health care and a lost opportunity with and for patients and their families.- The power of attachment. The force of attachment as a human need and drive must be harnessed if we are to change painful and problem behaviors. Relationships are the key to remedying human suffering -- both individual and collective. - As a rule, less is more. Mental health treatments, both medical and psychosocial, have often been aggressive, from high doses of drugs to intensive sessions and psychic confrontation in individual and group psychotherapy. Unfortunately, these high risk efforts infrequently provide help and often have unwanted and problematic effects. Primum non nocere -- first, do no harm -- is the first law of medicine.- Chronic stress is the enemy. From adverse childhood experiences to posttraumatic stress, chronic stress can be an underlying factor in the development of many mental disorders. However, chronic stress can be understood and contained, thereby reducing its damage. </p><p>Dr. Sederer synthesizes the knowledge gained through his considerable experience as a psychiatrist with insights gleaned from history, research and literature to address the four truths in a systematic, yet lively, manner. The result is a book of rare grace. Improving Mental Health: Four Secrets in Plain Sight will be a touchstone for the clinician and general reader alike.</p> Lloyd Sederer has written this book to help laypeople and practitioners see whats right before their eyes, but often unnoticed. He explores four secrets that behaviors have meaning, that attachment is central to health (and recovery), that doing more often means doing more harm, and that chronic stress may be the most debilitating condition of life...This is well worth reading, digesting, and using as a foundation for interactions between clinicians and the people they aim to serve.--Paul Gionfriddo, President and CEO, Mental Health America <p> There are secrets hiding in plain sight, so writes Dr. Lloyd Sederer in his new (10th!) book, which can make a real difference in the lives of people with mental and addictive disorders and their families. He is not only right; he reveals these secrets using stories, anecdotes, science, and history. This is a must and wonderful read for clinicians and for those affected by these all so common conditions. --Linda Rosenberg, MSW, President and CEO, National Council for Behavioral Health</p></p><p><p>In Improving Mental Health: Four Secrets in Plain Sight, Dr. Lloyd Sederer, a renowned psychiatrist, clinical administrator, and public health advocate, explores four foundational truths he has identified over his extensive career. These "secrets," as he calls them, are hidden in plain sight. They are epiphanies, which can enable practitioners, patients and families to better understand mental illness and improve lives. Written for clinicians in both mental health and primary care, as well as lay readers, this eloquent and concise book is full of apt, beautifully crafted patient stories designed to illuminate four secrets for a happier life. Dr. Sederer also uses historical incidents, wisdom culled from books and movies, and research findings to support his theme.</p><p>Rarely are books written for mental health practitioners so richly drawn, compassionate, and insightful.

It has a reputation as a dry and difficult subject, a glorified form of geometry complicated by tedious computation. In this book, Eli Maor draws on his remarkable talents as a guide to the world of numbers to dispel that view. Rejecting the usual arid descriptions of sine, cosine, and their trigonometric relatives, he brings the subject to life in a compelling blend of history, biography, and mathematics. He presents both a survey of the main elements of trigonometry and a unique account of its vital contribution to science and social development. Woven together in a tapestry of entertaining stories, scientific curiosities, and educational insights, the book more than lives up to the title <i>Trigonometric Delights.</i></p><p>Maor, whose previous books have demystified the concept of infinity and the unusual number "e," begins by examining the "proto-trigonometry" of the Egyptian pyramid builders. He shows how Greek astronomers developed the first true trigonometry. He traces the slow emergence of modern, analytical trigonometry, recounting its colorful origins in Renaissance Europe's quest for more accurate artillery, more precise clocks, and more pleasing musical instruments. Along the way, we see trigonometry at work in, for example, the struggle of the famous mapmaker Gerardus Mercator to represent the curved earth on a flat sheet of paper; we see how M. C. Escher used geometric progressions in his art; and we learn how the toy Spirograph uses epicycles and hypocycles.</p><p>Maor also sketches the lives of some of the intriguing figures who have shaped four thousand years of trigonometric history. We meet, for instance, the Renaissance scholar Regiomontanus, who is rumored to have been poisoned for insulting a colleague, and Maria Agnesi, an eighteenth-century Italian genius who gave up mathematics to work with the poor--but not before she investigated a special curve that, due to mistranslation, bears the unfortunate name "the witch of Agnesi." The book is richly illustrated, including rare prints from the author's own collection. <i>Trigonometric Delights</i> will change forever our view of a once dreaded subject.</p></p><p><p>"If you think trigonometry has no more surprises for you, read <i>Trigonometric Delights</i>. Eli Maor will change your mind. The book presents the subject and its history the way they should be presented--it's a delight to read."--<b>Paul J. Nahin, author of <i>Duelling Idiots and Other Probability Puzzlers</i></b></p><p>"This book will appeal to a general audience interested in the history of mathematics. I highly recommend [it] to teachers who would like to ground their lessons in the sort of mathematical investigations that were undertaken throughout history."--<b>Richard S. Kitchen, Mathematics Teacher</b></p><p>"[Maor] writes enthusiastically and engagingly. . . . Delightful reading from cover to cover. Trigonometric Delights is a welcome addition."--<b>Sean Bradley, Mathematical Association of America</b></p><p>"Here is trigonometry viewed through the lens of history--a rich, intriguing book that will leave readers shouting for Maor."--<b>William Durham, author of <i>The Mathematical Universe</i>.</b></p><p>"Maor eases the reader from the mathematical puzzles of the Rhind Papyrus all the way to infinite series and the analysis of music produced by vibrating strings. Along the course, he leads a grand tour of the lovely but often neglected area of mathematics called trigonometry."--<b>Jerry P. King, Professor of Mathematics at Lehigh University</b></p><p>"This is a rich and challenging book that will appeal to mathematicians and should help attract a newer generation to the subject. By putting the history back into trigonometry, Maor tells the many stories of trigonometry, and shows that what is often regarded as a collection of dry techniques is really a marvelous testament to thousands of years of human ingenuity and intellectual creativity."--<b>Keith Devlin, author of <i>Mathematics: The Science of Patterns</i> and <i>Goodbye Descartes</i></b></p><b>Eli Maor</b> teaches the history of mathematics at Loyola University in Chicago.

The book is organized around the authors' division into eight primary events:<br>Food-producing revolution (6000&#x2013;3000 B. C.)<br>Appearance of urban society (3000&#x2013;2000 B. C.)<br>Birth of Greek science (600&#x2013;300 B. C.)<br>Revolution in power (Middle Ages)<br>Rise of modern science (seventeenth century)<br>Steam and the Industrial Revolution (eighteenth century)<br>Electricity and the beginnings of applied science (nineteenth century)<br>Age of automatic control (twentieth century)<br>Not an exhaustive history, this book focuses on those achievements whose impact on civilization, in the authors' view, has been most significant. In the case of specific inventions, machinery or other man-made creations, the book offers a comprehensive, detailed description, including an overall perspective, an analysis of component parts and their interrelationships, a presentation of essential dimensions, and techniques of construction or assembly. Implied throughout the text is the idea of technology as a creative near-artistic that plays a role in what Cassirer has called "the process of man's progressive self-liberation." The book concludes with a well-balanced essay on the impact of engineering on society, in which the authors argue that technology must be subservient to ethical and aesthetic values.<br>Enhanced by 181 illustrations, <i>Engineering in History</i> is a superb blend of history and applied science that will interest not only engineers and students of technology, but any reader curious about the epochal strides man has made toward understanding, adapting to and learning to utilize his physical environment.</p><p></p><h2>Living on the Earth</h2><p>The thirtieth anniversary edition of <b>Living On The Earth</b> maintains the innocence, lyricism and whimsy of the original, enriched with current information on sustainable technology and protection of the environment. At once a practical manual of recipes and directions for creating from scratch all of life's basic amenities and some of its frivolities, an influential artist book with an instantly identifiable style, an insider's view of the Utopian commune movement of the early seventies, and a spiritually uplifting lifestyle book, <b>Living On The Earth</b> continues as a beloved addition to our bookshelves.</p><p><blockquote><i>When we depend less on industrially produced consumer goods, we can live in quiet places. Our bodies become vigorous; we discover the serenity of living with the rhythms of the earth. We cease oppressing one another.</i></blockquote><p> Oppression hasn't quite disappeared in the 30 years since Alicia Bay Laurel wrote these words, but, thanks to the enduring legacy of the back-to-the-land movement and the possibilities of telecommuting alike, more and more people are living in the "quiet places" Laurel celebrates. <i>Living on the Earth</i> was a well-worn (and bestselling) bible for the urban hipsters who fled the city and took up such pursuits as organic farming and leather tanning in the early 1970s; its author, a musician and artist who now makes her home in Hawaii, made their acclimation to country life just a little bit easier with her user-friendly instructions on such matters as how to keep gophers from invading the veggie patch and how to get rid of those nasty lice that once served as the mascots of bohemian existence.</p><p> Lice or no, the countryside still has its undeniable charms. The reissue of Laurel's handwritten, simply illustrated manual will appeal to anyone contemplating a new life beyond the city--or merely seeking pointers on how to simplify daily life. Things have changed, of course, since Laurel first self-published her zeitgeist-drenched book in 1970. Where the original edition had seed-to-bud instructions for growing marijuana, the reissue now comes with a modest disclaimer in which Laurel admits to having lost her taste for the stuff decades ago--but it also comes with a ringing endorsement for the use of hemp fiber and paper as a planet-friendly measure of economy. Laurel also juxtaposes her folk remedies for common ailments with a friendly reminder to head to the doctor if the pain is really bad, the kind of advice once shunned by the proudly self-sufficient barefoot medics, manuals in hand. Still, though updated here and there, <i>Living on the Earth</i> retains its recipes for everything from making Moroccan <i>djellabas</i> to molding scented candles to delivering a baby in the privacy of one's tipi, all good things to know.</p><p> More than a blast from the past--although it certainly is that--Laurel's book is still highly useful. And it's just plain fun. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br>"LIVING ON THE EARTH is beautiful to see, hold, touch. The drawings and design radiate warmth, simplicity, sincerity. The whole effect of the book, as an object, is to induce serenity and goodwill � The information in it is useful to everybody everywhere who wants to enjoy and play with the good things in this life."<br>--Raymond Mungo, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"LIVING ON THE EARTH is a living experience. It compounds all of the Whole Earth Catalog�s hard-core information with all of the personal warmth and feeling that a girl with a melodically infatuating name like Alicia Bay Laurel could possess. � It reads as if she were writing a never-ending letter to you and you alone."<br>--The Village Voice<br><br>"May well be the best book in this catalog,"<br>--Whole Earth Catalog<br></p><h2>The Skull Talks Back: And Other Haunting Tales</h2><p><p>Do you dare<br> to cross paths with ...</p><p>An enchantress who can slip<br>in and out of her skin,<br>A man more evil than the devil,<br>A skull who talks back,<br>A pair of creepy feet that can<br>walk on their own?</p><p>Spooky, chilling, and fantastical, this collection of six scary tales will send shivers up your spine!</p><p>The stories in the skull talks back have been selected from <em>Every Tongue Got To Confess</em>, Zora Neale Hurston's third volume of folklore. Through Joyce Carol Thomas's carefully adapted text and Leonard Jenkins's arresting illustrations, the soulful, fanciful imaginations of ordinary folk will reach readers of all ages.</p></p><p><p>Zora Neale Hurston was a novelist, folklorist, and anthropologist. An author of four novels (<em>Jonah&#x2019;s Gourd Vine</em>, 1934; <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, 1937; <em>Moses, Man of the Mountain</em>, 1939; and <em>Seraph on the Suwanee</em>, 1948); two books of folklore (<em>Mules and Men</em>, 1935, and <em>Tell My Horse</em>, 1938); an autobiography (<em>Dust Tracks on a Road</em>, 1942); and over fifty short stories, essays, and plays. She attended Howard University, Barnard College and Columbia University, and was a graduate of Barnard College in 1927. She was born on January 7, 1891, in Notasulga, Alabama, and grew up in Eatonville, Florida. She died in Fort Pierce, in 1960.&nbsp; In 1973, Alice Walker had a headstone placed at her gravesite with this epitaph: &#x201c;Zora Neale Hurston: A Genius of the South.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Leonard Jenkins received his B.F.A. from the American Academy of Art in Chicago. He is the illustrator of <em>Sunflower Island</em> by Carol Greene, which received a starred review in <em>Publishers Weekly</em>. Mr. Jenkins lives in New York City.</p><br><br><p>Joyce Carol Thomas is an internationally renowned author who received the National Book Award for her first novel, <em>Marked By Fire</em>, and a Coretta Scott King Honor for <em>The Blacker the Berry</em> and for her first picture book, <em>Brown Honey in Broomwheat Tea</em>. Her picture book <em>I Have Heard of a Land</em> received a Coretta Scott King Honor and an IRA/CBC Teachers' Choice Award and was an ALA Notable Book. Her other titles include <em>The Gospel Cinderella</em>, <em>Crowning Glory</em>, <em>Gingerbread Days</em>, and <em>A Gathering of Flowers</em>. Ms. Thomas lives in Berkeley, California.</p>Grade 4-6&#x2013;Thomas retells six supernatural folktales selected from Hurston's <i>Every Tongue Got to Confess</i> (HarperCollins, 2001). The subject matter is sufficiently scary to give young readers a thrill, and Jenkins's spooky black-and-white paintings of skeletons, skulls, arrogant men, eerie cats, and nighttime swirls of fog perfectly set the stage for shivers. Thomas omits most of the dialect and supplies missing motivation. In "The Witch Who Could Slip off Her Skin," the reteller adds silly explanatory paragraphs telling why this witch would "ride" people who had done her wrong. She eliminates the character of "Marster" from "Big Sixteen," here called "Big, Bad Sixteen." "Bill, the Talking Mule," a tale in which a farmer is frightened when his animals suddenly speak to him, retains all of the surprise hilarity of the original. An adapter's note doesn't explain the changes so much as review the content. Although mostly faithful to Hurston's tales, the retellings read like fragments from some larger work that begin in the middle and end abruptly, a fact that may trouble readers who expect more shape to a story. However, this volume introduces a small part of the huge body of literature collected in the rural South in the 1920s and the person who helped put words to paper.<i>&#x2013;Susan Hepler, Burgundy Farm Country Day School, Alexandria, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"Painting at the Edge of the World" explores the possibilities of a redefinition and ''hybridization'' of painting begun in the 1960s, examining the manifestations of these new artistic vistas in the present day. This full-color catalogue features illustrations and a variety of critical texts by some of the most exciting established and emerging critical voices working today, in addition to work by an international and intergenerational group of artists hailing from places as diverse as Brazil, Ethiopia, Germany, South Africa, Scotland, Japan, Belgium, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Designed in two sections--a gatefold plate section containing reproductions of the work, and a french-folded section containing critical essays--the book brings together a wide range of contemporary views on painting from a diverse array of disciplines, including the visual arts, film, architecture, design, and music in an attempt to assess the relevance of painting in the contemporary global context. In addition, "Painting at the Edge of the World" includes documentation of each artist's work and an examination of their artistic methodology. Essays by: Daniel Birnbaum, Paulo Herkenhoff, Midori Matsui, Jorg Heiser, Frances Stark, Andrew Blauvelt, Reindaldo Laddaga, Yves-Alain Bois, Helio Oiticica, Takashi Murakami, Mike Kelley, and Cuauhtemoc Medina. Introduction by Douglas Fogle.

This exhibition catalog is published in conjunction with a show at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and addresses the current state of painting within the international avant-garde. It features 30 cutting-edge artists from around the world, with some more familiar names including Mike Kelley, John Currin, Marlene Dumas, Takashi Murakami, and Chris Ofili. The work of these artists is complemented by equally cutting-edge writing on contemporary painting, contributed by an array of academics, artists (many of whom are featured in the exhibit itself), and curators. The artist plates at the end of the catalog function as a small encyclopedia of contemporary painting, while large color gatefolds and brief profiles represent each of the artists in the exhibition. The design, though contemporary and stylish, can be cumbersome to the reader. Recommended for academic and specialized art collections.

The book presents the basic science knowledge used by biomedical engineers at a level accessible to all students and illustrates the first steps in applying this knowledge to solve problems in human medicine. Biomedical engineering now encompasses a range of fields of specialization including bioinstrumentation, bioimaging, biomechanics, biomaterials, and biomolecular engineering. This introduction to bioengineering assembles foundational resources from molecular and cellular biology and physiology and relates them to various sub-specialties of biomedical engineering. The first two parts of the book present basic information in molecular/cellular biology and human physiology; quantitative concepts are stressed in these sections. Comprehension of these basic life science principles provides the context in which biomedical engineers interact. The third part of the book introduces the sub-specialties in biomedical engineering, and emphasizes - through examples and profiles of people in the field - the types of problems biomedical engineers solve.</p><p>This book is an introduction to biomedical engineering, starting from the basics and demonstrating the engineering principles that are used to create new diagnostic methods and therapies for human disease.

It is quite literally a complete course in using the Tarot for divination and spirituality combined with the powerful system of Enochian magick. Written by two of the most prolific writers on the Enochian system, Gerald and Betty Schueler, this book crosses into astounding new territory which can literally change your life! <br> <br>This book includes three separate courses for learning how to use the cards. If you have never worked with the Tarot before, start with the two-week training program. If you know more, or if you have completed this course, take the four-week advanced program. Once you complete these, move on to the Master of Tarot course. <br> <br>These training programs outline what you need to practice and learn in order to give excellent Enochian Tarot readings. The actual details are in the rest of the book. This includes a history of both the Tarot and the Enochian magickal system. The spiritual and divinatory meaning of each card is given, as well as ten spreads you can use. <br> <br>Unique to this book are exact instructions on how to become a professional Tarot reader. This takes you step-by-step through the path of working with local and national government agencies so you can start a for-profit or non-profit Tarot reading business. <br> <br>Although designed as a companion to the <i>Enochian Tarot </i>deck (available separately), <i>The Enochian Tarot </i>can enhance your Tarot proficiency, further your understanding of magick and spirituality, and introduce you to, or increase your knowledge of the Enochian system. If you have ever wanted to learn either the Tarot or the Enochian system, this is an excellent introduction. And if you want to enhance your knowledge of either, this book is a must! <br> <br></p><p><p>Gerald Schueler and Betty Schueler have authored five other books on Enochian magick.&nbsp; They have also coauthored many articles on anthropology, computers, children, dogs, philosophy, magic and Theosophy.&nbsp; Gerald is a retired systems analyst and Betty is a computer consultant.</p> Gerald J.

The Schuelers have co-authored many articles on anthropology, computers, dogs, philosophy, science, magick, and other subjects. ~What is Enochian Tarot? <br>The Enochian Tarot is a deck of eighty-six cards designed by Gerald and Betty Schueler and rendered by Sallie Ann Glassman, an artistic member of the O. T. O. <br> <br>Enochian Magic was given to Dr. John Dee by a group of Angels through his psychic seer, Edmond Kelly, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth in England. All that we know today of the original system comes down to us largely from what remains of Dee's diaries and magical notes. <br> <br>In its original form, this magical system was largely one of ritual magic in which the magician could invoke or evoke various Angels or invisible beings. The Angels also gave Dee a magical language called Enochian, or simply, the Angelic Language. <br> <br>Since Dee's original notes, this magical system was expanded and elaborated by the Golden Dawn and by Aleister Crowley to include astral travel (called traveling in the spirit vision) to the regions described on Holy Tablets by the Angels to Dee. The Schuelers have now expanded this system to include a Tarot deck of eighty-six cards, each card containing a portrait or symbolic representation of one of these regions. <br> <br>The Enochian Tarot cards are primarily used to foretell the future but can also be used for rituals and for pathworking the Enochian magical universe. Forecasting the future is a superficial use of the powers of the Enochian Tarot. It is, rather, a powerful psychological tool that can allow you to look deep inside your subconscious and "see" the direction your life is taking. &nbsp; <br> <br>The Enochian Tarot is an-easy-to-use system of self-discovery that can help you see your self, your world, and all of the past, present, and future relationships between the two. <br> <br>Table 1 <br>Differences Between Tarot Decks TraditionalEnochian <br>Major Arcana (22)Major Arcana (30) <br>Minor Arcana (56)Minor Arcana (56) <br>WandsFire <br>SwordsAir <br>CupsWater <br>DisksEarth <br> <br>In order for you to use any Tarot deck for forecasting, you must accept the doctrine of free will-because if nothing in your future can be changed, then there is no real benefit to knowing what will happen beforehand. We need to accept the concept that each life is a many-branched road rather than a single straight path, that the future is a realm of possibilities. Each branch along the road represents a choice that we must make. Each new path has signposts to guide you. Some paths offer immediate rewards but end abruptly. Other paths are terribly complex and hard to navigate, but promise ultimate fulfillment at the end. Some paths are easily traveled, but offer no great prize at the conclusion. Each path has its own set of characteristics and remuneration. It is up to you to choose your path and to take the right branch as it appears. <br> <br>The Tarot is your map of life. With it you can choose the road you want to wander. Instead of being an uninformed victim of subconscious karmic forces, you can gather your inner strength and consciously change the path your life is to take. &nbsp; <br> <br>The Tarot is a magical key to self-determination and, with that key, we can open any door. <br> <br>Basic Tarot Terminology <br>Layout: The way the cards are placed in the spread. <br>Quester: A person wishing to have their fortune told. Also referred to as the enquirer or querent. <br>Reader: A person with the understanding and knowledge needed to read the Tarot cards. <br>Spread: The "pattern" formed by the cards laid out on the table before the reader. <br>Significator: The card which represents the quester. <br> <br>Basis of the Enochian Tarot System <br>This Enochian Tarot deck is specifically designed to be a medium of enlightenment. It is a map into the realms of spiritual bliss-a record of our relationship with the cosmos. In short, it is a textbook of occult teachings. The Golden Dawn equated each Tarot trump with a path on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. In this way, it was a symbolic map of inner space, describing the highways of consciousness from the lofty spiritual heights of divinity down to the material world of human beings and matter. Seen in this light, the purpose of the Golden Dawn Tarot and Enochian Tarot is identical. Although the "pathways" are slightly different, they can take you over the same terrain and should allow you to reach the same states and stages of consciousness. <br> <br>Each card of the Major Arcana represents a locality-one of thirty regions called the Aethyrs or Aires. Each card of the Minor Arcana represents a deity or group of deities who inhabit regions in what are called the Four Great Watchtowers. By using appropriate ritual and meditation techniques, you can focus your mind on a specific card, and it will act as a door into the corresponding region of the invisible worlds. Each card can also serve as a magical communication link between you and the deities who are pictured on it. The five main regions of these worlds defined in Enochian Magic are the Four Watchtowers and the Tablet of Union as shown in Table 2. <br> <br>Table 2 <br>Cosmic Planes in Enochian Magic <br>EnochianOccult &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Our Earthphysical plane <br>Watchtower of Earthetheric plane &nbsp; <br>Watchtower of Waterastral plane &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Watchtower of Airmental plane &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Watchtower of Firecausal plane &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Tablet of Unionspiritual plane &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br>Table 3, page 8, contains the correspondences between the Major Arcana cards, the letters of the Hebrew and Enochian alphabets, and planetary influences. <br> <br>Note: Hebrew and Enochian, when translated into English, have primary and secondary associations because the English alphabet has twenty-six letters, which is more than either Hebrew (twenty-two letters) or Enochian (twenty-one letters).

Dee and Kelly were given an ancient language that they called the Angelic, or Enochian, Language. The alphabet of this archaic language has twenty-one letters. It has its own grammar and syntax, but only a small sample of it has ever been translated into English. Dee and Kelly were directed by Angels to produce several tablets containing squares, with a letter in each square. Kelly would gaze into a crystal ball where he could see Angels and communicate with them, and Dee would record their conversations. <br> <br>Much of what Dee recorded is subject to interpretation, and there are several "schools" of Enochian Magic existing today. Probably, the three main schools are the Golden Dawn version, the O.T.O. version, and our own Schueler's version. This is discussed in more detail later. <br> <br>Together, they produced many curious tablets. Five of these are especially important-the Four Watchtower Tablets and the Tablet of Union. Each square on these tablets represents a region in the subtle invisible worlds that surround the Earth. Each tablet represents a map of one of the five Cosmic Planes of Manifestation. These planes exist in the regions between the divine plane and the matter of our gross physical plane. In addition, a person's body is made of the elemental substance of each plane. The planes interpenetrate each other and are named after the five known cosmic elements: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Spirit. Each tablet corresponds with a color, a direction, and a cosmic plane or element, as shown in Table 5. <br> <br>Table 5 <br>Watchtower Correspondences <br>Watch-ColorDirectionPlane towerElement <br>EarthblackNorthetheric <br>WaterblueWestastral <br>AiryellowEastmental <br>FireredSouthcausal <br>Tablet of Unionwhite--spiritual <br> <br>In addition to the Watchtowers and the Tablet of Union, thirty special regions, called the Aires, or Aethyrs, were also investigated. They range in serial order, from the most material to the most spiritual, and are complementary to the Watchtowers. The Watchtowers and Aethyrs of Enochian Magic have striking similarities with the Sephiroth and paths of the Tree of Life as taught in Qabalistic Magic. <br> <br>Enochian Magic, as we present it in our books, is a comprehensive system of magic. Besides the basic system (see Enochian Magic: A Practical Manual and An Advanced Guide To Enochian Magick, both by Llewellyn Publications), there is Enochian Physics (see our book Enochian Physics, Llewellyn Publications), Enochian Tarot (see our book Enochian Tarot, Llewellyn Publications), and Enochian Yoga (see our book Enochian Yoga, Llewellyn Publications). <br> <br>Enochian Physics is a structural analysis of the Enochian Magical Universe as experienced by us, the authors. Enochian Tarot is a new system of divination using the deities and locations of Enochian Magic. Like the traditional Tarot system, it can also be used for meditation and pathworking &nbsp;(which will be discussed later on). &nbsp;Enochian Yoga uses a system of yogic meditation, instead of rituals, to fulfill the goals of our Enochian Magic. <br> <br>The basic teachings relating to Enochian Magic and the Angelic Language as revealed by Dee and Kelly were taken up at the end of the last century by a secret occult group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn used the mysterious tablets and language in their rituals and magical ceremonies. They amplified Enochian Magic by creating what are known as the "signposts" of the squares. Just as a good map points out the major sites of an unknown area for a traveler, to prevent him or her from getting lost, so the signposts predict the general atmosphere, the names of the local deities, and so on, for each of the Watchtower squares. Two of the methods used by the Golden Dawn to visit these regions were skrying and traveling in the Spirit Vision. Skrying was the method used by Kelly to discover the Tablets. It involved gazing into a crystal or similar material and recording whatever visions were seen or voices heard. The Spirit Vision method is similar to what is known today as astral traveling-a consciously directed out-of-body experience. <br> <br>Today there are several schools of Enochian Magic, each with a slightly different emphasis but all stemming from the original work of John Dee. Our system has been dubbed Schueler's Enochian, and it is important for you, the reader and user of the Enochian Tarot deck, to understand that this card deck did not originate with Dee but with us, the Schuelers. <br> <br>The primary goal of Enochian Magic, as we define it, is the attainment of knowledge and power. You can accomplish this by visiting the subtle regions of the Cosmic Planes of Manifestation and conversing with the inhabitants and rulers of the regions. The method generally used for this is pathworking the Watchtowers and Aethyrs. The knowledge and power gained should give you a better understanding of yourself and your world. According to our interpretation of Enochian Magic, we do not have to be a slave to the forces of cosmic justice (karma) that always seem to control our lives. We can, through meditation and pathworking in Enochian Magic, consciously direct our life and, therefore, our destiny. <br> <br>The Enochian Tarot Deck <br>Our Enochian Tarot is a deck of eighty-six cards that is divided into two main sections: a Major Arcana and a Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana is a set of thirty picture cards that can also be called the Greater Enochian Arcana, Enochian Trumps, Atouts, or Triumphs. These cards are symbolic representations of various cosmic forces such as Doubt, Intuition, Glory, etc. The Minor Arcana contains fifty-six cards that represent main regions within the Four Watchtowers. We divided the Minor Arcana into four suits: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. Table 6, pages 18-19, contains a list of the cards of the Enochian Major and Minor Arcanas. <br> <br>Table 6 <br>Card Names of the Major and Minor Arcanas <br>No.Major ArcanaMinor Arcana <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;1The BabeKings <br> &nbsp;2BabalonFirst Seniors <br> &nbsp;3The MagusSecond Seniors <br> &nbsp;4Cosmos &amp; ChaosThird Seniors <br> &nbsp;5The Arrow of Fourth Seniors <br>Truth <br> &nbsp;6The UrnFifth Seniors <br> &nbsp;7LoveSixth Seniors <br> &nbsp;8The Holy Higher Sephirothic <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Guardian Angel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross Angels <br> &nbsp;9The Daughter Lower Sephirothic <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;of Babalon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross Angels <br>10The AbyssKerubic Angels <br>11The Holy CityArchangels <br>12GloryRuling Angels <br>13Garden of NemoLesser Angels <br>14City of the Demons Pyramids <br>15The Cosmic Dance <br>16The Higher Self <br>17The Balance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>18The Vault &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>19The Priestess of the Silver Star <br>No.Major ArcanaMinor Arcana <br>20The Wheel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>21The Reincarnating Ego &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>22The Void <br>23Labor <br>24Travel <br>25Intuition <br>26Reason <br>27Solitude <br>28Doubt <br>29The Heavens <br>30The Four Regions <br>We have assigned traits to each card that are either positive or negative.

He&#39;s set the world a good example, which others would do well to sample, but it&#39;s a bore, when night and day the sick man forces you to stay! To keep him sweet, as if he&#39;s dying, give him his daily medicine and make quite sure that it goes in, adjust the pillows while one&#39;s sighing: &#39;Don&#39;t even think of getting well, The devil take you, go to hell!&#39; 2) Thus thought a ne&#39;erdowell and dandy whom Zeus had made his uncle&#39;s heir: to him the money&#39;d come in handy, so coach and horses rushed him there. For those who love my comic thriller of Ruslan and his dear Ludmilla, I&#39;ll introduce without ado, the hero of my tale to you: Onegin, whom I&#39;ve long befriended, had grown up on the Neva&#39;s shore, perhaps like you, dear reader, for St. Petersburg is truly splendid where once we wandered back and forth, though now I really hate the North. Chapter Five 1) That year the warm and autumn weather appeared to wish that it could stay, and nature dawdled, altogether reluctant ever to make way for winter; suddenly some flurries of shining snow arrived and hurried to cover fences, houses, lanes, drew patterns on the window panes. Tatiana wakes and sees the whitened and gleaming countryside; the trees in wintry silver, magpies please her eyes, the hills around now lighten as swirling snowflakes gently float, enclosing all in winter&#39;s coat. 2) So now it&#39;s wintertime! The peasant sets off, rejoicing in the day, his horse, in snow both crisp and pleasant, is snorting as it drags the sleigh, while fleet kibitkas glide for hours and throw up fluffy, snowy showers; the coachman drives with proud panache in sheepskin coat and crimson sash; a country urchin blithely scampers along and pulls his little sled on which a mongrel sits, instead of him; he laughs at frozen fingers, inflamed in all the biting cold, not caring as his mother scolds.</p><h2>The History of Beaufort County, South Carolina: 1514-1861</h2><p>In the first volume of The History of Beaufort County, South Carolina, three distinguished historians of the Palmetto State recount more than three centuries of Spanish and French exploration, English and Huguenot agriculture, and African slave labor as they trace the history of one of North America's oldest European settlements. From the sixteenth-century forays of the Spaniards to the invasion of Union forces in 1861, Lawrence S. Rowland, Alexander Moore, and George C. Rogers, Jr., chronicle the settlement and development of the geographical region comprised of what is now Beaufort, Jasper, Hampton, and part of Allendale counties.<br>The authors describe the ill-fated attempts of the Spanish and French to settle the Port Royal Sound area and the arrival of the British in 1663, which established the Beaufort District as the southern frontier of English North America. They tell of the region's bloody Indian Wars, participation in the American Revolution, and golden age of prosperity and influence following the introduction of Sea Island cotton.<br>In charting the approach of civil war, Rowland, Moore, and Rogers relate Beaufort District's decisive role in the Nullification Crisis and in the cultivation, by some of the district's native sons, of South Carolina's secessionist movement. Of particular interest, they profile the local African American, or Gullah, population a community that has become well known for the retention of its African cultural and linguistic heritage.</p><p>Lawrence S.

Though the Indians appeared eager to receive the Gospel, they also had a tendency to forget the missionaries&#x2019; lessons and &#x201c;revert&#x201d; to their natural state of war, cannibalism, and polygamy. This peculiar mixture of acceptance and rejection, compulsion and forgetfulness was incorrectly understood by the priests as a sign of the natives&#x2019; incapacity to believe in anything durably. </p><p>In this pamphlet, world-renowned Brazilian anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro situates the Jesuit missionaries&#x2019; accounts of the Tupi people in historical perspective, and in the process draws out some startling and insightful implications of their perceived inconstancy in relation to anthropological debates on culture and religion.</p></p><p><p><b>Eduardo Viveiros de Castro</b> is a professor at the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.</p>&#x201c;At once an anthropological interpretation of historical encounters between Europeans and &#x2018;natives,&#x2019; a critically reflexive approach to anthropological understandings of &#x2018;culture,&#x2019; &#x2018;belief,&#x2019; and &#x2018;identity,' and, perhaps most importantly for scholars working in Amazonia, a highly influential framework through which many ethnographers have come to understand indigenous cosmology and sociality. . . .

Since the publication of the last etymological dictionary of Greek, both the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, and our knowledge of the Greek substrate have led to numerous, often surprising new insights into the history and formation of the Greek vocabulary. This dictionary is a treasure trove covering 2000 years of Ancient Greek: from Mycenaean via Homer and the classical period to lexicographers, such as Hesychius (5th century A.D.). It consists of 7500 entries with thoroughly revised etymologies. Each entry gives clear information about the origin of the Greek word and its first date of attestation. It further provides all etymologically relevant variants, dialectal forms, derivatives, compounds, and bibliographical references. This dictionary is a truly indispensable tool for those in search of a deeper knowledge of the Greek vocabulary, its history and, therewith, a better understanding of the language.<b>Robert S. P.

These are spread throughout 44 lessons, the Appendices and the exercises as well as in the Tagalog&#x2013;English and English&#x2013;Tagalog vocabulary lists at the back of the book. The added Tagalog vocabulary is meant to keep learners abreast of changes that have occurred in the language since the first edition of <i>Basic Tagalog</i> which was published. This edition has retained all the grammar lessons, and the tried&#x2013;and&#x2013;tested teaching methodology developed b the author, Paraluman S. Aspillera, for the original version. Her method has proven to be extremely efficient for tens of thousands of foreigners and non&#x2013;Tagalogs who have used this book to learn to learn Tagalog, including many who have successfully learned to speak Tagalog, read Tagalog and write Tagalog through self&#x2013;study on their own without a teacher. An audio CD has also been added to facilitate the correct pronunciation of Tagalog words and phrases. A succinct introduction to the language and a description of the character of Filipinos will hopefully provide learners with a better understanding of the language they are learning. <br><br>The lessons in <i>Basic Tagalog</i> are intended for a three&#x2013;month period of intensive study followed by another three months of applied oral communication. In six months (or about 250 hours), it is expected that an average learner should be able to speak, write and understand simple, everyday, conversational Tagalog as spoken by most Filipinos. Highlights of this book include:<ul><li> Over 2,000 Tagalog words and expressions.</li><li> 44 lessons organized by organized for efficient language absorption.</li><li> Extensive exercises and activities to reinforce the lessons.</li><li> Vocabulary lists serve as comprehensive English&#x2013;Tagalog and Tagalog&#x2013;English dictionaries.</li><li> Completely updated and expanded with new materials.</li><li> Includes accompanying MP3 Audio CD.</li></ul>Using <i>Basic Tagalog</i> to study the Tagalog language will further encourage both non&#x2013;Tagalogs and non&#x2013;Filipinos to speak Tagalog better. Only then will they appreciate the individuality of the language that reflects the resilience and flexibility of Filipinos all around the world. In the end, such learning will improve daily interactions and communications between non&#x2013;Filipinos and Filipinos&#x2014;whether in business, education, tourism, social or civic endeavors.</p><p><b>Paraluman Aspillera</b>, author, teacher, and newspaper journalist, specialized in the teaching of English and Tagalog.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art.

As Jonathan Lethem contends in his Introduction, Dickens&#39;s &#34;genius . . . is at one with the genius of the form of the novel itself: Dickens willed into existence the most capacious and elastic and versatile kind of novel that could be, one big enough for his vast sentimental yearnings and for every impulse and fear and hesitation in him that countervailed those yearnings too. Never parsimonious and frequently contradictory, he always gives us everything he can, everything he&#39;s planned to give, and then more.&#34; This Modern Library Paperback Classic was set from the 1867 &#34;Charles Dickens&#34; edition.</p><h2>The Cosmic Web: Scientific Field Models and Literary Strategies in the 20th Century</h2><p><p>From the central concept of the field&#x2015;which depicts the world as a mutually interactive whole, with each part connected to every other part by an underlying field&#x2015; have come models as diverse as quantum mathematics and Saussure&#x2019;s theory of language. In <i>The Cosmic Web</i>, N. Katherine Hayles seeks to establish the scope of the field concept and to assess its importance for contemporary thought.

But literary critics, who are usually resistant to the application of scientific concepts in literary criticism, have rarely related imaginative literature to the field model. N.

Universities&#x2015;the institutions that bear so much responsibility for the future health of our nation&#x2015;are at odds with the very publics they are intended to serve. As Kathleen Fitzpatrick asserts, it is imperative that we re-center the mission of the university to rebuild that lost trust. </p><p>In <i>Generous Thinking</i>, Fitzpatrick roots this crisis in the work of scholars. Critical thinking&#x2015;the heart of what academics do&#x2015;can today often negate, refuse, and reject new ideas. In an age characterized by rampant anti-intellectualism, Fitzpatrick charges the academy with thinking constructively rather than competitively, building new ideas rather than tearing old ones down. She urges us to rethink how we teach the humanities and to refocus our attention on the very human ends&#x2015;the desire for community and connection&#x2015;that the humanities can best serve. One key aspect of that transformation involves fostering an atmosphere of what Fitzpatrick dubs "generous thinking," a mode of engagement that emphasizes listening over speaking, community over individualism, and collaboration over competition.</p><p>Fitzpatrick proposes ways that anyone who cares about the future of higher education can work to build better relationships between our colleges and universities and the public, thereby transforming the way our society functions. She encourages interested stakeholders to listen to and engage openly with one another's concerns by reading and exploring ideas together; by creating collective projects focused around common interests; and by ensuring that our institutions of higher education are structured to support and promote work toward the public good. Meditating on how and why we teach the humanities, <i>Generous Thinking</i> is an audacious book that privileges the ability to empathize and build rather than simply tear apart.</p></p><p><p>How do we solve the social and political crisis in America?

But soon Elizabeth learns that her first impressions may not have been correct, and the quiet, genteel Mr. Darcy might be her true love after all.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print".

Dr. Perry Cahall presents a theology of marriage that incorporates biblical, historical, and systematic perspectives while drawing upon Scripture and Tradition, with particular attention given to the Theology of the Body of Saint John Paul II. While there is certainly much scholarship on marriage, there is currently no book available in English that attempts to present a comprehensive theology of marriage from a Catholic perspective. Also, while there is a great deal of scholarly literature dealing with different aspects of marriage, and while there is an increasing amount of scholarship emerging on John Paul II s Theology of the Body, there does not yet exist a book that attempts to show the implications of the Theology of the Body for a comprehensive theology of marriage. This book represents a fresh approach to presenting the sacramental theology of marriage with a broad scope and incorporates the invaluable insights of the Theology of the Body given to us by John Paul II.</p><p>... this marvelous feast of a book also offers an extended reflection on the image of God; a study of the relation of eros and charity; a balanced analysis of the nature and goods of marriage; a detailed history of the development of the theology of marriage from the Old Testament through the twentieth century; an insightful treatment of marriage's place within the seven sacraments; a study of marital spirituality; a full-fledged and persuasive sexual ethics; an excellent discussion of the value of celibacy; and one of the best presentations I have ever seen of the unique marriage of Mary and Joseph. --Matthew Levering, PhD, Perry Family Foundation Professor of Theology, University of St. Mary of the Lake, Mundelein Seminary<br><br>After twenty-five years in the daily practice and teaching of canon law--with roughly half of that work being focused on marriage issues--I may say without exaggeration that it takes rather a lot to teach me something new about the Church and marriage. But Dr. Perry Cahall s The Mystery of Marriage does just that. Cahall demonstrates a solid command of the astonishing variety of sources that make up Church teaching on marriage, and then he draws on those sources in examining, in a careful and competent way, St. John Paul II s Theology of the Body. Cahall's study rewards not only selective, topical consultation, it also warrants a cover-to-cover reading. --Edward N. Peters, JD, JCD, Professor of Canon Law, Sacred Heart Major Seminary, Referendary, Apostolic Signatura<br><br>Perry J. Cahall expertly follows St. John Paul II in going back to the beginning of Genesis to discover the meaning of marriage, its mystery and sacramentality. A Church historian, Cahall ably portrays its long history and development. Especially noteworthy are the chapters on the Spirituality of Tenderness in marriage. This is a rich resource for seminaries and other teachers as well as those married couples seeking a deeper understanding of their vocation to love. --Mary Shivanandan STD, Emerita Professor of Theology, John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family, At the Catholic University of America</p><h2>She Had Some Horses: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>A new edition of the beloved volume by Joy Harjo, one of our foremost Native American poets.</strong></p> First published in 1983 and now considered a classic, <em>She Had Some Horses</em> is a powerful exploration of womanhood's most intimate moments.

A relationship between Auster, his typewriter, and the artist Sam Messer, who, as Auster writes, &#34;has turned an inanimate object into a being with a personality and a presence in the world.&#34; This is also a collaboration: Auster&#39;s story of his typewriter, and of Messer&#39;s welcome, though somewhat unsettling, intervention into that story, illustrated with Messer&#39;s muscular, obsessive drawings and paintings of both author and machine. This is, finally, a beautiful object; one that will be irresistible to lovers of Auster&#39;s writing, Messer&#39;s painting, and fine books in general.</p><p>Paul Auster is the author of many novels, among them &#34;Leviathan, Moon Palace, Mr. Vertigo,&#34; and &#34;Timbuktu&#34;. He has also written a memoir, &#34;Invention of Solitude&#34;, and translated several books from French. His most recent collaboration with an artist was his project with Sophie Calle, entitled &#34;Double Game&#34;. He lives in Brooklyn.Aspiring writers are often fascinated by the processes and the tools of the professional; in this elegant art book collaboration between writer Auster and painter Messer, they can get a detailed, expressionistic perspective on the old-fashioned machine Auster uses to get the words out of his head and onto the page: a vintage manual Olympia typewriter. "Since... 1974, every word I have written has been typed out on that machine," writes Auster in the essay that accompanies the drawings and paintings reproduced in this lovely volume. Though very short, the text is revealing of the author's unique sensibility: "Like it or not, I realized we [Auster and the Olympia] had the same past. As time went on, I came to understand we had the same future." The starring attraction here is the art. Primarily done in oils, the works reveal Messer's obsession with Auster's typewriter. Most of the depictions are head-on, sometimes with backgrounds that reflect the writer and his New York milieu. One version is backed by a shelf of Auster's works, another by the Brooklyn Bridge, and one haunting image shows the lower Manhattan skyline as seen from Brooklyn, with the still-standing towers of the World Trade Center prominently featured. The novelist himself is portrayed in several works, the best of which (Maestro) shows Auster conjuring the keys off of the machine and into a swirl of floating letters. This is an undeniably odd but captivating book, in which Messer, in Auster's words, turns "an inanimate object into a being with personality and a presence in the world." <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Albert Racinet: Illustrated History of European Costume</h2><p>The changing fashions in costumes and accessories from the medieval period to the 19th century are presented here through the beautiful colour lithographs of the great 19th-century French authority Albert Racinet. His original text has been edited to make his work more widely accessible but his intriguing snippets of information, such as how Renaissance Venetian women dyed their hair, and his personal comments on fashion excesses have been retained. For each period, from Antiquity to the Middle Ages and beyond, figures are drawn in a variety of positions with painstaking detail but with each drawing influenced by the period it is representing. There are also lavish illustrations of jewellery, hats, ruffs, pipes and living interiors. This large format book finishes with patterns for the toga and an assortment of other costumes. An enjoyable and colourful journey through European history.</p><p></p><h2>Gateways to Democracy</h2><p>GATEWAYS TO DEMOCRACY introduces you to the American political system, pointing out in each chapter the &#34;gateways&#34; that facilitate, or at times block, participation.

Beautifully written, lucidly conceived, and far-ranging in its implications, this work will help readers gain a better appreciation of the complexity of the social forces&#x2015; mostly androcentric&#x2015;that have shaped the symbolism of the sacred feminine. At the same time, it charts a new direction for finding a truly egalitarian vision of God and human relations through a feminist-ecological spirituality. <br><br>Rosemary Radford Ruether begins her exploration of the divine feminine with an analysis of prehistoric archaeology that challenges the popular idea that, until their overthrow by male-dominated monotheism, many ancient societies were matriarchal in structure, governed by a feminine divinity and existing in harmony with nature. For Ruether, the historical evidence suggests the reality about these societies is much more complex. She goes on to consider key myths and rituals from Sumerian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Anatolian cultures; to examine the relationships among gender, deity, and nature in the Hebrew religion; and to discuss the development of Mariology and female mysticism in medieval Catholicism, and the continuation of Wisdom mysticism in Protestanism. She also gives a provocative analysis of the meeting of Aztec and Christian female symbols in Mexico and of today's neo-pagan movements in the United States.</p><p>"The scholarship in this book is superior, revealing a depth of insight and a scope of knowledge possible only from a scholar who has lived with the concerns of feminist theology for decades. Ruether is a gifted storyteller, and lucidly translates complex ideas and debates. This work is of the highest importance, and Ruether asks the right questions at the right time. The text is groundbreaking."&#x2015;Nancy Pineda-Madrid, Saint Mary's College of California<br><br>"Ruether has provided a valuable introduction to an important feminist topic: what can we know about sacred female imagery in Western culture? She guides us through contemporary feminist scholarship, providing engaging narrative, and venturing her own interpretations. Ruether calls for feminists to move beyond divisions created by our different interpretations of prehistory and work together towards our common project of a more peaceful, just, and ecological world."&#x2015;Carol Hepokoski, Meadville Lombard Theological School<b>Rosemary Radford Ruether</b> is Carpenter Professor of Feminist Theology at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.

And the most recent, the American mortgage meltdown, has sent shock waves around the world. <em>Managed by the Markets</em>, which won the 2010 George R. Terry Book Award, offers an illuminating account of how finance has replaced manufacturing at the center of the American economy over the past three decades, explaining how the new finance-centered system works, how we got here, and what challenges lay ahead.<br><br>Since the early 1980s, Gerald F. Davis shows, finance and financial considerations have increasingly taken center stage, dramatically reshaping American society. Corporations now have an overriding focus on creating shareholder value, while their personnel practices no longer provide secure employment, economic mobility, health insurance, or retirement benefits. Instead, employees must become shareholding free-agents, left to their own fate. Banking has shifted from the traditional role of taking in deposits and making loans to the widespread use of "securitization," turning loans (such as mortgages or corporate debt) into bonds owned by institutional investors. The financial services industry is both more concentrated among large banks and mutual funds, yet more spread out among under-regulated specialists such as mortgage finance companies and hedge funds. And states increasingly act as "vendors" in a global marketplace of law, emulating firms such as Nike, hiring contractors to do much of the work of government. <br><br>As a result, individuals and households find their welfare tied to the stock market and the mortgage market as never before. And the turbulence of recent years starkly underscores the dangers of depending too much on financial markets. Written in the spirit of C. Wright Mills' penetrating <em>The Power</em> <em>Elite</em> and <em>White Collar</em>, this brilliant study provides an invaluable map of the finance-driven American society.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gerald F.

Consolidating a diverse array of theoretical and empirical studies into an analytical framework that clarifies and challenges the assumptions that have guided organizational culture research, this pathbreaking book delineates three competing perspectives and offers a way out of the conceptual chaos caused by conflicts among these viewpoints. This analysis acknowledges incommensurabilities without creating pressures toward assimilation, while offering insights unavailable to any single perspective. Exploring links to major intellectual developments (postmodernism, feminist theory, environmental dependence) within and outside of organizational theory, Cultures in Organizations brings a critical, interdisciplinary perspective to the field. This theoretical approach has an extensive empirical base, drawing on studies of a wide variety of organizations, including a large multi-national electronics corporation, the Peace Corps, universities, small non-profit organizations, and several large and small private-sector companies. By alternating between theoretical abstractions and studies of particular organizations, Joanne Martin delineates and bridges divergent approaches to the study of cultures in organizations, offering a breadth and an openness to multiple viewpoints not available elsewhere.</p><p><br>Joanne Martin is Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Graduate School of Business and also, by courtesy, in the Department of Sociology at Stanford University.

A truly path-breaking achievement. (Robert B. Pippin, University of Chicago)<br><br>In this book, a great Kant scholar asks two fundamental questions about the extraordinary period of German philosophy from 1781&#x2013;1806. Why did Kant claim that he had begun philosophy anew&#x2015;and why did Hegel think that he had brought it to an end? Eckart F�rster's answers are historically cogent and philosophically challenging. They are rooted in the deepest learning yet, at the same time, presented with extraordinary clarity. <i>The Twenty-Five Years of Philosophy</i> is a masterpiece. (Michael Rosen, Harvard University)<br><br>For several years, scholars working in the vibrant field of German Idealism&#x2015;philosophers, literary critics, historians of science, art historians&#x2015;have been tensely awaiting the appearance of F�rster's major synthetic study of the period. But <i>The Twenty-Five Years of Philosophy</i> exceeds even the most extravagant expectations. In its combination of detailed historical and textual reconstruction with penetrating philosophical thought, in its unrivalled perspicuity of presentation, in its narrative drive, F�rster's book will reward its readers' engagement in every respect. It is masterful in its command of the work of Kant, Jacobi, Spinoza, Fichte, Schelling, Goethe, and Hegel. It is moving in its commitment to philosophical reflection of the boldest order. Its clarity is marvelous to behold. No serious student of the period will read this book only once. (David E. Wellbery, University of Chicago)<br><br>Kant maintained that philosophy finally had begun with his Critique of Pure Reason in 1781. In 1806, Hegel claimed that philosophy was now completed. Therefore, philosophy existed for only 25 years. In this masterful book, F�rster examines the conceptions of philosophy held by Kant and Hegel that required them to make such seemingly extravagant pronouncements. F�rster argues that, astonishingly, they were correct. To do this, he provides synthetic and critical examinations of not only the crucial texts and arguments of Kant and Hegel but also those of Spinoza, Jacobi, Fichte, Goethe, Herder, and Schelling. F�rster's command of the historical sources is most impressive. Moreover, this book is clearly written, and Bowman's translation is commendable.

This book examines the creative response to that challenge. It offers critical analysis of the speeches and writings that set forth the platform and arguments of the early woman's rights movement and guided its development from the 1840s through the early decades of the twentieth century.</p><p></p><p>Following an introductory overview of the movement, Campbell examines the rhetoric of leading female abolitionists whose initial struggle revolved around achieving the right to speak in public. She next looks at their response to opposition based on theology and the universal moral standard the reformers proposed. The author describes the rhetoric of the various woman's rights conventions and how movement leaders adapted their appeals to male legislators. Conflicts between social and natural rights feminists and between white and Afro-American women are considered, and the rhetorical positions that came together to achieve suffrage are analyzed. In her final chapter, Campbell comments on the rhetoric of the National Woman's Party and the demise of the woman's rights movement in the 1920s. A stimulating analysis of the rhetorical contributions of the best-known and most effective of America's early female reformers, this work, together with its companion volume, should be considered for courses on American public address, women's rhetoric, social movements, and U.S. women's history.</p></p><p><p>This volume offers critical analysis of the speeches and writings that set forth the platform and arguments of the early woman's rights movement and guided its development from the 1840s through the early decades of the 20th century.

Despite the enormous amount of secondary scholarship available on Heidegger, it is - due to the complexity of his thought and the density of his writing - difficult for the curious beginner to gain an insight into Heidegger's philosophy. Heidegger For Beginners serves as an entry into the ideas of one of the 20th century's most important thinkers, situating Heidegger's thought within its philosophical and historical context - alongside such thinkers as Plato, Descartes, Kant, Nietzsche, Husserl and Sartre.<br>Heidegger For Beginners explicates many of Heidegger's central ideas, including the Nothing, average-everydayness, care, existence, being-in-the-world, the One, the critique of technology, anxiety, and most importantly, Being - a notion which may offer us the key to understanding the very mystery of our own existence. Explained here in a way which makes it both accessible and relevant, Heidegger's thought not only challenges an entire intellectual tradition, but also challenges our own self-conceptions, the very manner in which we, as humans choose to exist.</p><p>Eric LeMay taught writing at Columbia, the University of Chicago, and Harvard.

But the strict rules of proper Swiss society at the beginning of the twentieth century dictated that a woman of Emma&#x2019;s stature&#x2014;one of the richest heiresses in Switzerland&#x2014;travel to Paris to "finish" her education, to prepare for marriage to a suitable man. </p><p>Engaged to the son of one of her father&#x2019;s wealthy business colleagues, Emma&#x2019;s conventional and predictable life was upended when she met Carl Jung. The son of a penniless pastor working as an assistant physician in an insane asylum, Jung dazzled Emma with his intelligence, confidence, and good looks. More important, he offered her freedom from the confines of a traditional haute-bourgeois life. But Emma did not know that Jung&#x2019;s charisma masked a dark interior&#x2014;fostered by a strange, isolated childhood and the sexual abuse he&#x2019;d suffered as a boy&#x2014;as well as a compulsive philandering that would threaten their marriage. </p><p>Using letters, family interviews, and rich, never-before-published archival material, Catrine Clay illuminates the Jungs&#x2019; unorthodox marriage and explores how it shaped&#x2014;and was shaped by&#x2014;the scandalous new movement of psychoanalysis. Most important, Clay reveals how Carl Jung could never have achieved what he did without Emma supporting him through his private torments. The Emma that emerges in the pages of <em>Labyrinths </em>is a strong, brilliant woman, who, with her husband&#x2019;s encouragement, becomes a successful analyst in her own right.</p></p><p><p>Emma was clever, attractive, and wealthy, one of the richest heiresses in Switzerland, when, at age seventeen, she met and fell in love with Carl Jung, a brilliant but penniless doctor working in a lunatic asylum. Determined to share his adventurous life and to continue her own studies, she was too young to understand Carl&#x2019;s complex personality, which was laden with secrets, or to conceive what dramas lay ahead.</p><p><em>Labyrinths</em> tells the story of Emma and Carl&#x2019;s unconventional marriage, their friendship and subsequent rift with Sigmund Freud, and their contribution to the development of psychoanalysis. In its many twists and turns, the Jung marriage was indeed labyrinthine, and Emma was forced to fight with everything she had to keep her husband close to her. Carl&#x2019;s belief in polygamy led to many affairs, including a m�nage � trois with a former patient, Toni Wolff, that lasted some thirty years. But as Emma came to understand her husband better, the marriage thrived, and finally, always encouraged by Carl, Emma emerged to become a noted analyst in her own right.</p><p>At the center of this gripping book is a resourceful and intelligent woman long overshadowed by her famous husband, and the inside story of the foundations of the psychoanalytic movement.</p><p>Catrine Clay has worked for the BBC for over twenty years, directing and producing award-winning television documentaries.

Symphonies, chamber music, opera, church music, and songs (more than 600 of them) poured forth in profusion. His &#34;Trout&#34; Quintet, his &#34;Unfinished&#34; Symphony, the last three piano sonatas, and above all his song cycles Die Schone Mullerin and Winterreise have come to be universally regarded as belonging to the very greatest works of music? Who was the man who composed this amazing succession of masterpieces, so many of which were either entirely ignored or regarded as failures during his lifetime? In this new biography, Elizabeth McKay paints a vivid portrait of Schubert and his world. She explores his family backround, his education and musical upbringing, his friendships, and his brushes and flirtations with the repressive authorities of Church and State. She discusses his experience of the arts, literature, and theater, and his relations with the professional and amateur musical world of his day. She traces the way Schubert&#39;s manic-depression became an increasingly significant influence in his life, responsible at least in part for social inadequacies, professional ineptitude, and idiosyncrasies in his music. And she examines Schubert&#39;s decline after he contracted syphilis, looking at its effect on his music and emotional life.</p><p>The author may not be especially inspired, but she&#39;s very readable, and she takes a straightforward approach to Schubert&#39;s life. She discusses the nature of Schubert&#39;s &#34;sexual profligacy&#34; and the possibility of his being homosexual without coming down on one side or the other. She believes that Schubert was manic-depressive (and that several other members of his family were as well), and advances some convincing evidence for her view. This is a worthwhile addition to the shelf of Schubert biographies, a shelf that is certain to continue to expand in the bicentenary year of his birth.Franz Schubert (1797-1828) was born in Vienna of immigrant parents. During his short life he produced an astonishing amount of music. Symphonies, chamber music, opera, church music, and songs (more than 600 of them) poured forth in profusion. His &#39;Trout&#39; Quintet, his &#39;Unfinished&#39; Symphony, the three last piano sonatas, and above all his song cycles Die Schone Mullerin and Winterreise have come to be universally regarded as belonging to the very greatest works of music. Who was the man who composed this amazing succession of masterpieces, so many of which were either entirely ignored or regarded as failures during his lifetime? In her new biography, Elizabeth Norman McKay paints a vivid portrait of Schubert and his world. She explores his family background, his education and musical upbringing, his friendships, and his brushes and flirtations with the repressive authorities of Church and State. She discusses his experience of the arts, literature and theatre, and his relations with the professional and amateur musical world of his day. Schubert&#39;s manic-depressive temperament became of increasing significance in his life, and McKay shows how it was partly responsible for his social inadequacies, professional ineptitude, and idiosyncracies in his music. She examines Schubert&#39;s uneven physical decline after he contracted syphilis, traces its effects on his music, his hedonism, and sensuality, and investigates the cause and circumstances of his death at the age of 31.</p><h2>The Buccaneers</h2><p>Set in the 1870s, the same period as Wharton's <b>The Age of Innocence</b>, <b>The Buccaneers</b> is about five wealthy American girls denied entry into New York Society because their parents' money is too new. At the suggestion of their clever governess, the girls sail to London, where they marry lords, earls, and dukes who find their beauty charming&#x2014;and their wealth extremely useful.<p>After Wharton's death in 1937, <b>The Christian Science Monitor</b> said, "If it could have been completed, <b>The Buccaneers</b> would doubtless stand among the richest and most sophisticated of Wharton's novels." Now, with wit and imagination, Marion Mainwaring has finished the story, taking her cue from Wharton's own synopsis. It is a novel any Wharton fan will celebrate and any romantic reader will love. This is the richly engaging story of Nan St. George and guy Thwarte, an American heiress and an English aristocrat, whose love breaks the rules of both their societies.</p></p><p>The upper stratum of New York society into which <b>Edith Wharton</b> was born in 1862 provided her with an abundance of material as a novelist but did not encourage her growth as an artist. Educated by tutors and governesses, she was raised for only one career: marriage. But her marriage, in 1885, to Edward Wharton was an emotional disappointment, if not a disaster. She suffered the first of a series of nervous breakdowns in 1894. In spite of the strain of her marriage, or perhaps because of it, she began to write fiction and published her first story in 1889.Her first published book was a guide to interior decorating, but this was followed by several novels and story collections. They were written while the Whartons lived in Newport and New York, traveled in Europe, and built their grand home, the Mount, in Lenox, Massachusetts. In Europe, she met Henry James, who became her good friend, traveling companion, and the sternest but most careful critic of her fiction.&nbsp;<i>The House of Mirth</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1905) was both a resounding critical success and a bestseller, as was&nbsp;<i>Ethan Frome</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1911). In 1913 the Whartons were divorced, and Edith took up permanent residence in France.&nbsp;Her subject, however, remained America, especially the moneyed New York of her youth. Her great satiric novel,&nbsp;<i>The Custom of the Country</i><b>&nbsp;</b>was published in 1913 and&nbsp;<i>The Age of Innocence</i>&nbsp;won her the Pulitzer Prize in 1921.In her later years, she enjoyed the admiration of a new generation of writers, including Sinclair Lewis and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In all, she wrote some 30 books, including an autobiography,&nbsp;<i>A Backward Glance</i>&nbsp;(1934). She died at her villa near Paris in 1937.<br><br><b>Marion Mainwaring</b>&nbsp;(1922-2015) was an Edith Wharton scholar most notable for having completed Wharton&#x2019;s unfinished manuscript <i>The Buccaneers </i>in 1993. In addition to her research focused on Wharton, Mainwaring also published several original works including the novels&nbsp;<i>Murder in Pastiche: Or Nine Detectives All at Sea </i>and&nbsp;<i>Murder at Midyears</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>as well as a biography on Wharton's lover, <i>Mysteries of Paris: The Quest for Morton Fullerton</i>.Dana Ivey reads in a quiet, even voice providing an interesting taste of Wharton&#39;s literary style and genre.

At weekends he retires to Laverings Estate with his wife, Catherine. He may be pompous, and they may seem ill-matched, but the couple are devoted to each other.</p><p>When Jack's widowed sister, Lilian, and her two stepchildren arrive to spend the summer in the neighbouring house, he dreads the intrusion to his idyll: Daphne, capable and ambitious, is too lively for his taste, whereas her brother Denis, a composer, he finds a crashing bore. But their wit and good sense charm the residents of Barchester, and they win over Lord Bond with an impromptu Gilbert and Sullivan evening. Even Jack begins to thaw.</p><p>Before long, Daphne and Lord Bond's son become attracted to each other, but each believes the other is attached to someone else. Can disaster be averted before she marries the wrong man? </p><p>First published in 1939, B<i>efore Lunch</i> is a sparkling comedy from Angela Thirkell's much-loved classic series.</p></p><p>As the title of this bright, unashamedly nostalgic novel suggests, Angela Thirkell had a genius for the quotidian. Published in 1939, <b>Before Lunch</b> was the last of Thirkell's books published before the darkening shadow of World War II made her glittering, reassuring portrait of the English countryside (embodied in "Barsetshire," her own Yoknapatawpha County) seem more and more anachronistic. The minor Thirkell renaissance currently proceeding has produced no more blessedly uplifting heroine than Lilian Stoner, the heroine of <b>Before Lunch</b>.Angela Thirkell (1890-1961) was the eldest daughter of John William Mackail, a Scottish classical scholar and civil servant, and Margaret Burne-Jones. Her relatives included the pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones, Rudyard Kipling and Stanley Baldwin, and her grandfather was J. M. Barrie. She was educated in London and Paris, and began publishing articles and stories in the 1920s. In 1931 she brought out her first book, a memoir entitled<i> Three Houses</i>, and in 1933 her comic novel <i>High Rising</i> - set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, borrowed from Trollope - met with great success. She went on to write nearly thirty Barsetshire novels, as well as several further works of fiction and non-fiction. She was twice married and had four children.</p><h2>Clinical Practice Guidelines for Midwifery &amp; Women's Health</h2><p>Clinical Practice Guidelines for Midwifery &amp; Women's Health, Fourth Edition is a trusted quick reference guide to midwifery and well woman care.

Beisner addresses these issues by recasting the questions involved, and synthesizes the most useful contributions of both traditional and revisionist historians. From the Old Diplomacy to the New reinterprets the entire period as one in which American foreign policy underwent a fundamental paradigm shift that affected the goals and methods of diplomacy. A commitment to systematic policy and a determination to promote American interests in a dangerous world characterized the &#34;new diplomacy.&#34;</p><p><p>Robert L. Beisner is the author of From the Old Diplomacy to the New: 1865 - 1900, 2nd Edition, published by Wiley.</p>"Robert Beisner has provided a good updating of an already solid work, and <i>From the Old Diplomacy to the New</i>&nbsp;can be recommended for a nineteenth-century diplomatic history course."

A chapter on books and readers in the Greek world concludes Part IV. Each part has its own appendix of authors and works, a list of works cited, and an index.The period from the eight to the fifth centuries B.C. was one of extraordinary creativity in the Greek-speaking world. Poetry was apublic and popular medium, and its production was closely related to developments in contemporary society. At the time when the city states were acquiring their distinctive institutions epic found the greatest of all its exponents in Homer, and lyric poetry for both solo and choral performance became a genre which attracted poets of the first rank, writers of the quality of Sappho, Alcaeus and Pindar, whose influence on later literature was to be profound. This volume covers the epic tradition, the didactic poems of Hesiod and his imitators, and the wide-ranging work of the iambic, elegiac and lyric poets of what is loosely called the archaic age.</p><h2>Palisades Amusement Park: A Century of Fond Memories</h2><p><p>In 1898, a rustic picnic ground on the New Jersey Palisades overlooking the Hudson River and Manhattan began a transformation into one of the greatest amusement parks in the world. Its attractions over the course of nearly seventy-five years of operation reflected the popular culture of a changing nation: from the high-diving horses of the twenties to the rock 'n' roll shows of the fifties and sixties, along with perennial favorites like the fun house and the Tunnel of Love, the famous Cyclone&nbsp; roller coaster, and the carousel. The Park was the place where many turn-of-the century dwellers saw their first flying machines, and it was the backlot for several early motion pictures.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>With the cooperation of hundreds of residents, former employees, and executives of the Park, Vincent Gargiulo has provided a comprehensive history of Palisades Amusement Park. The Park's personnel included such notables as Arthur Godfrey and Buster Crabbe; W. C. Fields, Jean Harlow, Johnny Weismuller, and Jackie Coogan were among the many celebrity regulars. Top entertainers like Tony Bennett, Chubby Checker, Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, the Jackson Five, and Frankie Avalon performed for record crowds at its famed open-air theater. The Park inspired a hit song, Freddy Cannon's "Palisades Park,"&nbsp; and it played host to numerous contests, such as the Diaper Derby and the Miss American Teen-Ager pageant. Every summer weekend thousands of visitors enjoyed "the world's largest salt-water pool," vinegar-soaked french fries, and the cacophony of sounds on the midways.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>For the millions who visited the Park until it closed in 1971, this book is sure to bring back cherished memories. And for amusement park and roller coaster fans never lucky enough to have entered its colorful gates, it will re-create the thrills, laughter, and joy that was "Palisades."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;</b></p></p><p>Vince Gargiulo grew up in Cliffside Park under the glow of the famed amusement park. He is the founder and executive director of Palisades Amusement Park Historical Society, author of an earlier Palisades history, and writer and coproducer of an award-winning Palisades television documentary. His excitement and eagerness to keep the park&#39;s memories alive are reflected on every page of Palisades Amusement Park.The amusement park that grew on the New Jersey Palisades overlooking the Hudson River could always be identified by its trademark blend of "entertainment, nature, and colorful attractions." In 1898, a picnic ground was turned into a paradise for some 300 million visitors who thereafter flocked to Palisades Park before its closure in 1971. The Palisades became one of America's favorite amusement parks, and its owners had a knack for letting the park reflect the culture of the nation. The austerity of the 1920s saw Kewpie-doll prizes replaced by coffee and sugar; the 1940s promoted beauty pageants such as Miss Eyeglass-wearing; the 1950s saluted rock and roll; the 1960s gave rise to rocket ships. Fire and accidental deaths marred the park's history, but the crowds never stopped coming. Big names from Benny Goodman to the Jackson Five appeared at the park until it was declared a "gaudy nuisance" by its neighbors and the country lost an icon, "hand-built of wood, metal and grease." A fascinating read for anyone who's ever ridden a roller coaster or wishes she had. <i>Patricia Hassler</i></p><h2>Conformity and Conflict: Readings in Cultural Anthropology (12th Edition) (MyAnthroKit Series)</h2><p><p> <b>An ideal complement to standard anthropology texts or as a stand-alone text/reader, the best-selling <i>Conformity and Conflict</i> continues to offer an in-depth look at anthropology as a powerful way to study human behavior and events.</b> </p> <p>The 37 articles cover a broad range of theoretical perspectives and demonstrate basic anthropological concepts.

Unlike artists of landscapes or still-life, the animal illustrator must adhere to this golden rule: <i>observe much and long and draw quick and little</i>. This respected guidebook, written by renowned wildlife illustrator Charles Liedl, shows you how. <br>In <i>How to Draw Animals</i>, artists of every level will learn the techniques for portraying animals accurately and gracefully, whether the creatures are in action or repose. Keen advice on the importance of visually mastering the subject's anatomy gives way to invaluable guidance on line sketching, outlining, shading, form, tone, and detail. More than 100 expert illustrations include muscular and skeletal characteristics, and detail the development process in creating an enormous variety of wild and domestic breeds: horses, deer, game birds, dogs, cats, rabbits, foxes, buffalo, zebras, tigers, wolves, and many more. The author also provides tips on the best media to use and how to use them, as well as how to guide an animal to turn or resume a pose. A time-honored art instruction guide, both motivational and inspirational, this volume is a must-have for the bookshelves of every artist.</p><p></p><h2>Informal Logic: A Handbook for Critical Argumentation</h2><p>This is an introductory guide to the basic principles of constructing good arguments and criticizing bad ones. It is nontechnical in its approach, and is based on 150 key examples, each discussed and evaluated in clear, illustrative detail. The author explains how errors, fallacies, and other key failures of argument occur. He shows how correct uses of argument are based on sound argument strategies for reasoned persuasion and critical questions for responding. Among the many subjects covered are: techniques of posing, replying to, and criticizing questions, forms of valid argument, relevance, appeals to emotion, personal attack, uses and abuses of expert opinion, problems in deploying statistics, loaded terms, equivocation, and arguments from analogy.</p><p>"A fine book on informal logic, also known as `critical thinking'... The treatment of topics throughout is thorough and meticulous; fine analytic distinctions, a large number of real life illustrations, and clear writing enhance the value of the work."

In this new edition, authors Joe Sambrook and David Russell have completely updated the book, revising every protocol and adding a mass of new material, to broaden its scope and maintain its unbeatable value for studies in genetics, molecular cell biology, developmental biology, microbiology, neuroscience, and immunology. Handsomely redesigned and presented in new bindings of proven durability, this three-volume work is essential for everyone using todays biomolecular techniques. The opening chapters describe essential techniques, some well-established, some new, that are used every day in the best laboratories for isolating, analyzing and cloning DNA molecules, both large and small. These are followed by chapters on cDNA cloning and exon trapping, amplification of DNA, generation and use of nucleic acid probes, mutagenesis, and DNA sequencing. The concluding chapters deal with methods to screen expression libraries, express cloned genes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells, analyze transcripts and proteins, and detect protein-protein interactions. The Appendix is a compendium of reagents, vectors, media, technical suppliers, kits, electronic resources and other essential information. As in earlier editions, this is the only manual that explains how to achieve success in cloning and provides a wealth of information about why techniques work, how they were first developed, and how they have evolved.</p><p>&#34;In every kitchen there is at least one indispensable cookbook. Sambrook and Russell&#39;s Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual fills the same niche in the laboratory.

The writings include <i>Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania</i>&#x2014;the "farmer" being the gifted and courageous statesman John Dickinson and <i>Letters from the Federal Farmer</i>&#x2014;he being the redoubtable Richard Henry Lee of Virginia. Together, Dickinson and Lee addressed the whole remarkable range of issues provoked by the crisis of British policies in North America, a crisis from which a new nation emerged from an overreaching empire. Dickinson wrote his <i>Letters</i> in opposition to the Townshend Acts by which the British Parliament in 1767 proposed to reorganize colonial customs. The publication of the <i>Letters</i> was, as Philip Davidson believes, "the most brilliant literary event of the entire Revolution." Forrest McDonald adds, "Their impact and their circulation were unapproached by any publication of the revolutionary period except Thomas Paine's <i>Common Sense</i>." Lee wrote in 1787 as an Anti-Federalist, and his <i>Letters</i> gained, as Charles Warren has noted, "much more widespread circulation and influence" than even the heralded <i>Federalist Papers</i>. Both sets of <i>Letters</i> deal, McDonald points out, "with the same question: the never-ending problem of the distribution of power in a broad and complex federal system."

Most of these changes are minor and are in response to student questions and comments. Numerous additional examples have been included to illustrate points that needed clarification. </p><p> More specifically, the material on reports of physical site conditions has been shifted from its previous location in Chapter 4 to a more appropriate place in Chapter 5 on contract "red flag" clauses. Chapter 18, on allocating responsibility for delays, has been extensively revised and expanded with new material and illustrations. Finally, a new Chapter 22 on the important subject of construction contract claims has been included before the final chapter in the book on dispute resolution, which now appears as Chapter 23. </p><p> The response from university faculty who use the book has been encouraging and my sincere thanks are due to them for the helpful comments I have received. I would also like to thank the reviewers of this second edition, who include David Bilbo, Texas A&amp;M University; Dianne H. Kay, Southern Illinois University; and John Wiggins, New Jersey Institute of Technology. Finally, I remain grateful to Ed Francis, Executive Editor at Prentice Hall, for his continued encouragement and support; to the entire Prentice Hall editorial staff; and especially to my students at California State University, Chico, who have been immensely helpful in revising this second edition. </p><p> Stuart H. Bartholomew<br> Chico, California<br> March 2001 Preface to the First Edition </p><p> This book was written primarily as a teaching text for senior students in baccalaureate university programs in construction engineering or construction management who plan careers in the contracting or construction management segments of the industry. It should also serve as a useful reference for the younger, less-experienced person in construction contracting or construction management organizations as well as owners of small contracting firms or related businesses. The material, drawn from various sources, has been organized and presented in the light of the writer's many years in the industry and 13 years' experience in teaching construction management courses at California State University, Chico. </p><p> I am not a lawyer, and this book does not purport to offer legal advice. A competent construction attorney should always be sought for that purpose. This book does, however, furnish practical guidance for construction practitioners in typical everyday situations empirically by examination of the more common case law holdings and the customs and practices of the industry. </p><p> The field of construction law is so broad that difficult choices must be made in deciding what to include in a text primarily intended for a single three-semester-hour university course. Accordingly, I have tailored the material to those areas that, in the light of my own experience, seem most fundamental, leaving such topics as claims preparation, presentation, and defense; damages quantification; and CPM scheduling techniques, and the like to the authors of the many excellent specialized texts on these subjects available today. Similarly, I have excluded detailed discussion of mechanic lien laws and similar topics that vary widely from state to state. </p><p> The Table of Contents should provide the reader an immediate referral to topics of particular interest. The key words and concepts used and developed in each chapter are listed in the beginning of the chapter. These should prove helpful as a study guide and to test recollection as the reader completes the chapter. Also, each chapter concludes with a series of questions and problems. The questions provide a direct opportunity for testing comprehension of the material. The problems have been designed to develop the reader's understanding in the context of typical industry situations. </p><p> Many individuals have indirectly contributed to this book. They include Harvey Slocum, a legendary figure in heavy construction, who gave me my first job more than 50 years ago, and John Soult, Wallace Hunt, and Floyd Crawford (all now deceased) who furnished continual encouragement and support during my years at Fruin-Colnon Corporation. Also, extremely capable construction attorneys have skillfully guided me over the years and contributed to my understanding of legal matters. They include Harold Blasky, Esq., with both the law firms of Max E. Greenberg, Trayman, Cantor &amp; Blasky and Schnader, Harrison, Segal &amp; Lewis; Overton Currie, Esq., Aubrey Currie, Esq., and Tom Kellerher, Esq., all with the law firm of Smith, Currie &amp; Hankock; John Tracy, Esq., at various times with the law firms of Lewis, Mitchell, &amp; Moore, Gadsby &amp; Hanna, and Thompson &amp; Waldron; Lewis Baker, Esq., with the law firm of Watt, Tieder &amp; Hoffer; James Hawkins, Esq., Michael Wilson, Esq., and Larry Luber, Esq., all with Greensfelder, Hemker &amp; Gale; and William McInerney, Esq., and Robert Leslie, Esq., with the law firm of McInerney and Dillon. In addition, I would like to thank Robert Leslie, who stole many hours from his busy schedule to review an early draft of the book and offered countless helpful criticisms and suggestions for improvement. </p><p> Finally, shared construction experiences with my many friends&#x2014;engineers, owners, and contractors alike&#x2014;have inevitably shaped the content of this book. These individuals will have no difficulty in recognizing much of themselves in its pages. </p><p> To all who have shared and influenced my life in construction, named and not named, I am profoundly grateful. This book is my offer of thanks&#x2014;by the means of passing on to young people today, with their careers ahead of them, what we collectively learned and wish we had known when we were their age. </p><p> Stuart H.

Sunstein combines legal theory with behavioral economics to make a fresh argument about the legitimate scope of government, bearing on obesity, smoking, distracted driving, health care, food safety, and other highly volatile, high-profile public issues. Behavioral economists have established that people often make decisions that run counter to their best interests&#x2014;producing what Sunstein describes as &#x201c;behavioral market failures.&#x201d; Sometimes we disregard the long term; sometimes we are unrealistically optimistic; sometimes we do not see what is in front of us. With this evidence in mind, Sunstein argues for a new form of paternalism, one that protects people against serious errors but also recognizes the risk of government overreaching and usually preserves freedom of choice.<br><br> Against those who reject paternalism of any kind, Sunstein shows that &#x201c;choice architecture&#x201d;&#x2014;government-imposed structures that affect our choices&#x2014;is inevitable, and hence that a form of paternalism cannot be avoided. He urges that there are profoundly moral reasons to ensure that choice architecture is helpful rather than harmful&#x2014;and that it makes people&#x2019;s lives better and longer.</p><p>Can there be anything libertarian about paternalism? Isn&#x2019;t �libertarian paternalism&#x201d; a contradiction in terms? <br> &nbsp; <br> Libertarian paternalism is no contradiction. All over the world, people are recognizing that we can adopt approaches that preserve freedom of choice, but that also steer people in helpful directions. Consider a GPS: you can ignore it if you want, but it gives you a route that is often pretty sensible. So, too, a restaurant might highlight healthful meals and put them in a special part of the menu. If so, it is engaging in libertarian paternalism. An employer might automatically enroll you in a savings plan or a health care plan�but allow you to opt out. That&#x2019;s a form of libertarian paternalism. The government might give people certain warnings, designed to reduce the risks associated with smoking or texting while driving. If the goal is to steer people in directions that will make their lives longer, then the government is engaged in libertarian paternalism. There&#x2019;s no contradiction in combining freedom of choice with a little steering. And because it's a form of �choice architecture,&#x201d; impossible to avoid, steering is pretty much inevitable. <br> &nbsp; <br> Should people be allowed to make mistakes? Are there times when they shouldn&#x2019;t? <br> &nbsp; <br> Sure, people should be allowed to make mistakes. We learn from what we do, even if our decisions don&#x2019;t turn out so well. If our choices don&#x2019;t affect anyone else, freedom of choice is a good place to start. But it isn&#x2019;t a good place to end. If people really are making catastrophic decisions, and if the benefits of preventing the catastrophe clearly outweigh the costs, we might be able to overcome the presumption in favor of freedom of choice.<b>Cass R.

Believers have long viewed these and similar involuntary experiences as religious--as manifestations of God, the spirits, or the Christ within. Skeptics, on the other hand, have understood them as symptoms of physical disease, mental disorder, group dynamics, or other natural causes. In this sweeping work of religious and psychological history, Ann Taves explores the myriad ways in which believers and detractors interpreted these complex experiences in Anglo-American culture between the mid-eighteenth and early-twentieth centuries.</p><br><p> Taves divides the book into three sections. In the first, ranging from 1740 to 1820, she examines the debate over trances, visions, and other involuntary experiences against the politically charged backdrop of Anglo-American evangelicalism, established churches, Enlightenment thought, and a legacy of religious warfare. In the second part, covering 1820 to 1890, she highlights the interplay between popular psychology--particularly the ideas of "animal magnetism" and mesmerism--and movements in popular religion: the disestablishment of churches, the decline of Calvinist orthodoxy, the expansion of Methodism, and the birth of new religious movements. In the third section, Taves traces the emergence of professional psychology between 1890 and 1910 and explores the implications of new ideas about the subconscious mind, hypnosis, hysteria, and dissociation for the understanding of religious experience.</p><br><p> Throughout, Taves follows evolving debates about whether fits, trances, and visions are natural (and therefore not religious) or supernatural (and therefore religious). She pays particular attention to a third interpretation, proposed by such "mediators" as William James, according to which these experiences are natural <i>and</i> religious. Taves shows that ordinary people as well as educated elites debated the meaning of these experiences and reveals the importance of interactions between popular and elite culture in accounting for how people experienced religion and explained experience.</p><br><p> Combining rich detail with clear and rigorous argument, this is a major contribution to our understanding of Protestant revivalism and the historical interplay between religion and psychology.</p></p><p><i>Fits, Trances, &amp; Visions</i> is a wide-ranging cultural study of some of the most controversial and dramatic expressions of Christian spirituality. Faith healing, possession, clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences, speaking in tongues, animal magnetism, and even hypnotized crabs are among the many subjects described by the fearless Ann Taves, a professor of history and religion at Claremont College. The book's primary focus is the debate between religion and psychology about the sources of such dramatic spiritual experiences. From the mid-18th to the early 20th century, believers and skeptics clashed over the question of whether God was supernaturally present in these experiences, or whether they were merely natural expressions of physical disease or psychological disorder. Taves is especially attentive and sympathetic to the conclusion reached in the early 20th century by William James, who argued that charismatic spirituality was <i>both</i> natural and religious. Taves does sometimes get bogged down in theoretical language, but <i>Fits, Trances &amp; Visions</i> is noteworthy for offering sympathetic and sophisticated attention to a realm of religious experience that too often receives little more than scholarly scorn. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>"The breadth of the book is truly remarkable, both across time and across perspectives. To move coherently from debates over the phenomena of the colonial Great Awakening to debates over both modern psychology of religion and early Pentecostalism, while at the same time moving back and forth between adepts and explainers of religious experiences is a real accomplishment."--<b>Mark A. Noll, Wheaton College</b></p> <p>"Taves offers both a history of American Protestant piety and a history of American psychology (in popular as much as academic modes). She creatively balances narratives of dramatic religious experience with varied naturalistic explanations that have been advanced since the Enlightenment. This is a grand enterprise--one of impressive breadth and seasoned scholarship."--<b>Leigh Schmidt, Princeton University</b></p></p><h2>Swim!: How a Shark, a Suckerfish, and a Parasite Teach You Leadership, Mentoring, and Next Level Success</h2><p><p><b>A fascinating story about the power of networking, connection, and mentorship</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Written as an engaging parable, <i>Swim! How a Shark, a Suckerfish, and a Parasite Teach You Leadership, Mentoring, and</i> Next <i>Level Success</i> brings to life real-world challenges (and their solutions) and presents them in simple, yet powerful terms. The book explores the vital importance of networking, explores the steps that lead to successful networking, and explains why we need it.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Swim!</i> dives deep into the concepts of mentorship and the power of human connection. While too many business leaders spend their time obsessing about facts, figures, and the bottom line, it is more important for them to learn to manage relationships. Once attention shifts to relationships, businesses and careers can reach the next level of success. Written by a leading motivational speaker, this book offers ideas that can be applied to both personal and business life.</p> <ul> <li>Understand the importance of establishing habits and rituals</li> <li>Tap into the power of a positive mindset</li> <li>Discover the value of teamwork</li> <li>Learn to use intentional language about workplace culture</li> </ul> <p><i>Swim!</i> is an entertaining book that highlights the significant concept of connecting and building relationships and includes the tools needed to become more self-aware about our roles and contributions in our industries.</p></p><p><p>In business, just as in any competitive social endeavor, we often feel driven to rise to the top by working tirelessly until we have beaten out the others and left them behind. Although this is a standard view of how to get ahead, what successful people know is that this is not how it's really done. To achieve lasting success and make a difference in the world, we need to learn how to work with, not against, the people around us. But here's the trick&#x2014;this only works if we cultivate a network of people at every level who can help us become our best selves, and avoid the ones who are not bringing value to our lives. </p><p>In <i>Swim!</i>, Walter Bond proves the principle that being a "big fish" requires complex collaboration with all the creatures in the ocean around us. In this modern parable, we learn that, in nature, sharks actually work together with smaller fish to deal with the parasites that plague them. By providing protection for suckerfish, which eat the parasites, sharks are able to dominate the seas alongside their small-scale friends. Sharks also respect their environments, taking care to investigate their options before moving forward. </p><p>To rise to new heights as business leaders and mentors, we can apply the same principle. By carefully choosing our associates and providing assistance and guidance, we can cultivate relationships that enable us to achieve the level of success we dream of. This book provides a fresh yet timeless perspective on the power of human connection, showing how we can achieve next-level results if we stop focusing on facts and figures and instead pour our energy into managing relationships. </p><p>Readers of <i>Swim!</i> will enjoy an engaging tale that's appropriate for people at all career stages&#x2014;from students to top executives. One of the book's key themes is that mistakes happen. Real "sharks" learn that admitting to their mistakes and accepting second chances is one of the most powerful actions leaders can take. Our past does not define us; instead, we are the actions we take today to cultivate teams and networks that can help us thrive.</p><p><b>A PARABLE TO HELP YOU RISE TO NEW HEIGHTS</b> </p><p><i>Swim!</i> is a tale of people like you who learn how to become "sharks"&#x2014;big fish who know that nose-to-the-grindstone hard work is only a small piece of the puzzle when it comes to achieving what they want. In this book, Hall of Fame Business Speaker and former NBA star Walter Bond shares his expert knowledge of how it takes the right team to make a great leader. Learn what sharks in nature already know&#x2014;that being the best comes from cultivating relationships with the people who can help you become your best self. By avoiding "parasites"&#x2014;takers who bring no value to your endeavors&#x2014;and building a network of helpers, you can use relationship management to propel you to the top. </p><p>This book gives you permission to leave your past behind you. Our mistakes do not define us&#x2014;it's our ability to admit to our mistakes and keep moving forward that makes us great. After reading Swim!, you'll learn <b>The Sacred Six</b> lessons that will be indispensable as you strive to take your career to the next level, including how to: </p><ul> <li>Keep moving forward, no matter how difficult things seem</li> <li>Recognize and cultivate potential relationships of mutual benefit</li> <li>Value curiosity and lifelong learning as keys to success</li> <li>Achieve your own goals by helping to elevate others to new levels</li> </ul> <p>Who we connect with in life can make or break us. <i>Swim!</i> is your blueprint for becoming one of the sharks&#x2014;cultivate meaningful relationships and achieve your potential in the workplace and in life.</p></p><h2>Waterfowl: An Identification Guide to the Ducks, Geese and Swans of the World</h2><p>Identifies more than a hundred species of waterbirds, and includes information on characteristics, behavior, and range</p><p>Comprehensive monographs like Paul A. Johnsgard's Ducks, Geese, and Swans of the World ( LJ 1/1/79) do not emphasize field identification. Field guides are geographically limited and do not always give full coverage of variant plumages. Therefore, birders, hunters, and aviarists will be pleased by this authoritative guide by English writer Madge ( Birdwatching ) to the world's waterfowl in virtually every plumage. The 47 color plates by Burn (also English), with range maps and brief descriptions of field marks, are followed by 155 detailed species accounts; both sections are in taxonomic order.

In a parking garage in Oakland, California; on a pleasure boat on the Lake of Zurich in Switzerland; at a public market in Chiang Mai, Thailand&#x2014;artists operating at the intersection of art and cultural activism have been developing new forms of collaboration with diverse audiences and communities. Their projects have addressed such issues as political conflict in Northern Ireland, gang violence on Chicago's West Side, and the problems of sex workers in Switzerland. Provocative, accessible, and engaging, this book, one of the first full-length studies on the topic, situates these socially conscious projects historically, relates them to key issues in contemporary art and art theory, and offers a unique critical framework for understanding them.<br><br>Grant Kester discusses a disparate network of artists and collectives&#x2014;including The Art of Change, Helen and Newton Harrison, Littoral, Suzanne Lacy, Stephen Willats, and WochenKlausur&#x2014;united by a desire to create new forms of understanding through creative dialogue that crosses boundaries of race, religion, and culture. Kester traces the origins of these works in the conceptual art and feminist performance art of the 1960s and 1970s and draws from the writings of Mikhail Bakhtin, J�rgen Habermas, and others as he explores the ways in which these artists corroborate and challenge many of the key principles of avant-garde art and art theory.</p><p>"A definitive study of a coherent and fascinating set of art practices. Kester makes the concept of dialogical art more textured and complex with each new work he discusses, providing both richness of description and depth of understanding. Without being authoritarian or heavy-handed, the book is definitive, exhaustively researched, and comprehensive. It is likely to remain the premier resource of information on community-based dialogical art for years to come and will be required reading for all courses that deal with the social implications of art."&#x2014;Norman Bryson, Professor of Art History, University of California, San Diego, and Senior Researcher, Jan van Eyck Academy, Maastricht, the Netherlands<br><br>"Grant Kester has written a book of great insight, compassion, and civic courage.

Written as an afterword to this work, Concluding Unscientific Postscript is on one level a philosophical jest, yet on another it is Climacus's characterization of the subjective thinker's relation to the truth of Christianity. At once ironic, humorous, and polemical, this work takes on the "unscientific" form of a mimical-pathetical-dialectical compilation of ideas. Whereas the movement in the earlier pseudonymous writings is away from the aesthetic, the movement in Postscript is away from speculative thought. Kierkegaard intended Postscript to be his concluding work as an author. The subsequent "second authorship" after The Corsair Affair made Postscript the turning point in the entire authorship. Part One of the text volume examines the truth of Christianity as an objective issue, Part Two the subjective issue of what is involved for the individual in becoming a Christian, and the volume ends with an addendum in which Kierkegaard acknowledges and explains his relation to the pseudonymous authors and their writings. The second volume contains the scholarly apparatus, including a key to references and selected entries from Kierkegaard's journals and papers.</p></p><p>"The definitive edition of the <i>Writings</i>.

Keenan, M.I.T.; Frederick G. Keyes, M.I.T.; Philip G. Hill, Queen&#x2019;s University; and Joan G. Moore, M.I.T. During the past decade a substantial body of experimental data on thermodynamic and transport properties of water has been produced and published by research groups in the USSR, Great Britain, Czechoslovakia, Canada and the United States. This book presents the results of a new and independent correlation of all this new thermodynamic data and all previously existing data. It is a new work to replace the well-known and widely used Keenan and Keyes tables. The tables in this new book are based upon a unique accomplishment. For the first time the whole body of high-quality experimental data on liquid and vapor water has been faithfully represented by a single fundamental equation. From this equation all thermodynamic properties can be calculated for any state. This equation is believed to extrapolate dependably in temperature from the upper limit of precise measurement (about 1500�F) to about 2400�F. Because of the increasing importance to both the practicing engineer and the student of a wide variety of problems that cannot be approximated by steady-flow idealization, internal energies are tabulated for all states: saturated liquid and vapor, compressed liquid, and superheated vapor. A reasonable range of metastable states is covered as extensions of the superheated-vapor and compressed-liquid tables. The Mollier and temperature-entropy charts are extended to substantially higher pressures and temperatures. This book also includes a table for ice-vapor equilibrium, an improved chart of isentropic exponents, charts of Prandtl number, a set of charts of heat capacity of liquid and vapor, and extensive tables of viscosity and thermal conductivity reproduced from the documents of the Sixth International Conference on the Properties of Steam. The book features legible type set by a computer-controlled typesetting machine. This results in accuracy, compactness, and convenience.</p><p>Presents the results of the authors&#39; independent correlation of all new experimental and all previously existing data on thermodynamic and transport properties of water, replacing the widely used Keenan and Keyes tables.

Like all of his translations, Hinton&#39;s translation of the Tao Te Ching is mind-opening. It adds startling new dimensions to this text, revealing it as the originary text of deep environmental and feminist thought. In the past, virtually all translations of this text have been produced either by sinologists having little poetic facility in English, or writers having no ability to read the original Chinese. Hinton&#39;s fluency in ancient Chinese and his acclaimed poetic ability combine both of these essential qualifications. Together, they allow a breathtaking new translation that reveals how remarkably current and even innovative this text is after 2500 years.</p><p>David Hinton&#39;s many translations of ancient Chinese poetry have earned wide acclaim for creating compelling English poetry that conveys the actual texture and density of the originals. He has held numerous fellowships from The National Endowment for the Arts and The National Endowment for the Humanities. And in 1997, his work was awarded the Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets.

His fame is tied to the series of polychrome xylographs that illustrate the 108 heroes from the novel <i>Suikoden</i> (Brigands), a late-18th-century bestseller in China and Japan that described a band of brigands who defend those oppressed by injustice and government corruption. The book conjures imagery of violent, powerful warriors with muscular tattooed bodies&#x2015;imagery that today inspires manga, anime, tattoo artists and illustrators across the world. Kuniyoshi embraced the genre of warrior prints, but he was also interested in portraits of female beauties, kabuki actors, landscapes, children and ghosts, another greatly admired genre in Japan. Nonetheless, his name is above all associated with Arcimboldo-like composite figures, figures within figures and parodies of stories and battles. His images are fantastical, baroque, rich in color and detail, with imposing characters and dynamic actions. This book surveys the work of a versatile and intriguing figure whose impressive technique birthed a school that continued for generations.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Taste of Chaucer; Selections from the Canterbury Tales.</h2><p>Verses from the Canterbury Tales in the original and translated form provides an introduction to Chaucer and Middle English literature</p><p></p><h2>Math Level 6 (Teacher Guide) (Math Lessons for a Living Education)</h2><p><b>Teacher Guide for the 36-week, 6th grade <i>math</i> course!</b> <br> The vital resource for grading all assignments from the <i>Math Level 6</i> course, which includes: <ul> <li>All the quizzes for the course, as well as quiz answers and worksheet solutions.</li> <li>Cumulative reviews, final exam, and optional end of year student presentation.</li> </ul> <br> OVERVIEW: This course was designed to present math concepts in the context of real life so students learn to apply the rules and techniques to solving everyday problems. It will help students review and master important skills as they prepare to move into more advanced coursework. A special note about quizzes and tests included in this book: If a teacher has used the previous books in this series, he or she will be aware that they contain very few quizzes or tests. This is because they are written in such a way that students consistently demonstrate what they know. Level 6 is also written in this way, BUT because quiz and test taking is a skill that students need in life, they have been added at the end of each lesson. If you, as the teacher, do not want your student to take every single lesson quiz, simply use the lesson practice and review, which is directly before most of the quizzes. You decide what your student needs and adjust this course to fit them. <br> FEATURES: The calendar provides daily sessions with clear objectives for the worksheets and quizzes.</p><p>As a homeschooling mom and author, Angela O&#x2019;Dell embraces many aspects of the Charlotte Mason method, yet knows that modern children need an education that fits the needs of this generation.

Laudan both destroys and creates. With detailed, scathing criticisms, he attacks the 'pregnant confusions' in extant philosophies of science. The progress they espouse derives from strictly empirical criteria, he complains, and this clashes with historical evidence. Accordingly, Laudan constructs a remedy from historical examples that involves nothing less than the redefinition of scientific rationality and progress . . . Surprisingly, after this reshuffling, science still looks like a noble-and progressive-enterprise ... The glory of Laudan's system is that it preserves scientific rationality and progress in the presence of social influence. We can admit extra-scientific influences without lapsing into complete relativism. . . a must for both observers and practitioners of science."&nbsp;--<i>Physics Today</i>&nbsp;"A critique and substantial revision of the historic theories of scientific rationality and progress (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, Feyerabend, etc.). Laudan focuses on contextual problem solving effectiveness (carefully defined) as a criterion for progress, and expands the notion of 'paradigm' to a 'research tradition,' thus providing a meta-empirical basis for the commensurability of competing theories. From this perspective, Laudan suggests revised programs for history and philosophy of science, the history of ideas, and the sociology of science. A superb work, closely argued, clearly written, and extensively annotated, this book will become a widely required text in intermediate courses."--<i>Choice</i></p><p><b>Larry Laudan</b> is a contemporary philosopher of science and epistemologist.

This collection's editors are all connected with the Freedom Project; Berlin is the coordinator. The letters, reports and depositions included here, largely drawn from Union records, tell at first hand the human story of African Americans in the Civil War, which, the editors contend, was also a second American revolution. Between 1861 and 1865 government was transformed, citizienship redefined, social classes rearranged--and blacks were at the center of the process. The texts offered have a common denominator: the determination displayed by African American men and women to control their own destinies, especially in relations with whites. The editing and annotations are models of their kind, explaining and clarifying while preserving the originals' authenticity and immediacy.

Its initial printing was a mere 2500 copies. &nbsp;Yet its first-time authors were interviewed by Matt Lauer on the "Today" Show, and BECOMING A CHEF went on to be hailed for launching "a new dimension in food writing, creating a standard for a whole new genre" (<i>The Record</i>).&nbsp;

Though he had little formal education, Donato loved French and Russian novels, and&nbsp;took night classes at the city college in construction and engineering.

It expands our understanding of the human potential for spiritual self-realization by interpreting it as the developing of a bodily-felt awareness informing our gestures and movements. The author argues that a psychological focus on our experience of well-being and pathology as embodied beings contributes significantly to a historically relevant critique of ideology. It also provides an essential touchstone in experience for a fruitful individual and collective response to the danger of nihilism. <br> Dr Levin draws on Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology to clarify Heidegger's analytic of human beings through an interpretation that focuses on our experience of being embodied. He reconstructs in modern terms the wisdom implicit in western and semitic forms of religion and philosophy, considering the work of Freud, Jung, Focault and Neitzsche, as well as that of American educational philosophers, including Dewey. In particular, he draws on the psychology of Freud and Jung to clarify our historical experience of gesture and movement and to bring to light its potential in the fulfilment of Selfhood. Throughout the book, the pathologies of the ego and its journey into Selfhood are considered in relation to the conditons of technology and the powers of nihilism.</p><p></p><h2>Bitter Spring: A Life of Ignazio Silone</h2><p>One of the major figures of twentieth-century European literature, Ignazio Silone (1900&#x20ac;&#x201c;78) is the subject of this award-winning new biography by the noted Italian historian Stanislao G.

A former fellow at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Italian Academy at Columbia University, and the University of Oxford, he is the author of <i>Carlo Rosselli: Socialist Heretic and Antifascist Exile </i>and the translator of Silone's <i>Memoir from a Swiss Prison</i>.</p><b>Prologue</b><p><b></b></p><b>The Landscape of My&nbsp;Soul</b>&nbsp; <p></p>What the"true" image of each of us may be in the end is a meaningless question. &#x2014;primo levi,"Lorenzo&#x2019;s Return" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In 1923,"Ignazio Silone" was born in a Spanish prison. Perhaps it was no coincidence&#x2014;and surely appropri-ate&#x2014;that at the time he was reading Dostoevsky. Secondino Tranquilli, the person whose identity he erased with hisnew name, had been born twenty-three years earlier in the rural Abruzzo region of Italy and burdened with the given name"Secondino," which, in the local dialect, meant"prison guard." In Spain, he had been writing for Andr�s Nin&#x2019;s journal La Batalla and imprisoned as a Communist. Significantly, he derived"Silone" from the ancient warrior Poppedius Silo, a native of Silone&#x2019;s beloved Abruzzo. Silo had led a successful revolt against the tyranny of Rome in 90 b.c. and thereby gained official recognition of the local population&#x2019;s autonomy."Ignazio" he borrowed from the SpanishCounter-Reformation saint Loyola in order to"baptize the pagan surname." In this defiant act of self-appellation and identity creation, he synthesized a classical, pagan past with the Christian tradition. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Silone has most often been associated with the protagonist of his novels Bread and Wine and The Seed Beneath the Snow, Pietro Spina. ("Read my books," he once said,"only in them do I fully recognize myself.") A Communistintellectual and activist, Spina is returning from exile to his native Abruzzo, hunted by the Fascist police. In order to elude arrest and move about the countryside, he dons the robes of a priest and becomes Don [Father] Paolo Spada. The metamorphosis from Pietro Spina (literally Peter [the] Thorn) to Paolo Spada (Paul [the] Sword) is revealing: The Communist"thorn" is transformed into the religious"sword." The American literary critic Edmund Wilson, after reading Silone&#x2019;s novels while sitting on the benches of the Villa Borghese Gardens in Rome, Italian dictionary at his side, perceptively sensed that Silone was"a queer mixture of priest and communist." Nicola Chiaromonte, Silone&#x2019;s fellow founder and editor of the literary-cultural journal Tempo Presente, and one of the few people who could claim to be close to the writer, intuited that Silone was in some ways a"prete contadino," a peasant priest. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Yet Silone&#x2019;s life and experience are reflected in many of his characters, not just Pietro Spina/Paolo Spada. There is the peasant Berardo Viola in Fontamara, Thomas the Cynic in The School for Dictators, the disillusioned party intellectual Rocco De Donatis in A Handful of Blackberries, the doggedly persistent Andrea Cipriani in The Secret of Luca, the compassionate Daniele of The Fox and the Camelias, self-effacing Pope Celestine V in The Story of aHumble Christian. But there is always a clear, explicit, and sincere identification with the poor Christ, the sufferingChrist, the peasant Christ who figures in the mythology of the rural poor. And in his last, unfinished work, Severina, Silone for the first and only time identifies himself with a female protagonist. Severina, a young convent initiate who refuses to give false testimony in court even though ordered to do so by her mother superior, grew out of Silone&#x2019;s fascination at the end of his life with Simone Weil. A member of the French underground, a writer, and a Jew who died by self-starvation in 1943, Weil inspired Silone to create Severina as bystander to a crime, thus embodying what writing meant for him:"the absolute necessity of bearing witness." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Representativeness was imposed on Silone, wrote R.W.B. Lewis in a profile that, now almost a half century old, is still thebest critical analysis of the writer."He scarcely had a chance to be Italian." Further complicating his portrait isthe essential paradox that defined him: his entrance into politics because of an essentially religious conception of the world."He became a socialist," Lewis writes,"because he wanted to become a saint." As a priest says of one ofSilone&#x2019;s characters,"socialism was his way of serving God." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Silone is a particularly difficult subject for the biographer because of the labyrinthine meanderings of his own identity and his enigmatic autobiographical comments. He believed that the true nature of any person could not be known because&#x2014;following the Neapolitan philosopher Giambattista Vico&#x2014;he insisted that man is not nature."Every man," he wrote,"is much more complicated than what he appears and that which he believes himself to be . . . to hell with psychology and facile suppositions." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Did Silone knowingly encourage a misreading and a conflation of his heroic and morally pure main characters with his own biography? Is it true, as others now insist, that Silone offered a confession for his transgressions as a police spy in a minor protagonist? The transfiguration from Secondino Tranquilli to Ignazio Silone was neither the first nor the last of his many self-transformations. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>When I asked Silone&#x2019;s widow about his fate in Italian literary circles and why no biography on him had been written in English, Darina Silone replied,"That situation was Silone&#x2019;s own fault; his&#x2014;to say the least&#x2014;extremely difficultcharacter." When I noted the challenge of tracking down documents in various archives and trying to fashion an identityfrom them, she was quick to respond."There are things that are not found in any archive," she insisted."Silone&#x2019;s character was difficult; his personality very complex. Of the few people alive who knew him personally, I am perhaps the one who knew him best, even if certainly not completely (no one ever knew him completely)." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Where, exactly, does identity lie? C. H. Cooley&#x2019;s"looking-glass" theory of self ("I am not who I think I am; I am not who you think I am; I am who I think you think I am") doesn&#x2019;t help us in Silone&#x2019;s case, for he simply did not care what others in the Italian political and literary establishments thought of him. But the biographer has a fertile mine in Silone&#x2019;s own writings. Rarely has an oeuvre been so autobiographical. All of Silone&#x2019;s novels except one take place in the Abruzzo region of Italy, as do his two plays. Rarely has so cosmopolitan a writer been so closely identified with the place ofhis birth."Look at Silone," said Albert Camus, noting the paradox in an interview after winning the Nobel Prize in Literature,"he is radically tied to his land but is the most European of writers . . . Silone speaks to all of Europe. If I feel myself tied to him it is because he is incredibly rooted in his national and even local tradition." Not that Silone engaged in any sentimental or nostalgic mythmaking of his origins. Indeed, one is struck by his complicated and ambivalent relationship with his hometown of Pescina. Notwithstanding all the autobiographical detail in his work, the problem of uncovering his identity still remains almost insurmountable for the biographer."There is no single truth about Silone," Darina Silone once said,"only many truths." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The writing is deceptively simple and presents the biographer with multiple challenges. Silone recognized himself in Hugo von Hof-mannsthal&#x2019;s dictum that writers are a human category for whom writing is more difficult than it is for anyone else."I live in a close communion with the characters in my stories that cannot be broken from one day to the next," Silone wrote. So close was that identification that the necessity of actually finishing a book was"an arbitrary and painfulact, an act against nature, at any rate, my nature." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The flawed, tragic hero is only one possible trope in crafting a biography of Silone. Like an ancient Hebrew prophet or oneof the early persecuted Christians, Silone insisted on a moral vision of the world. His writing&#x2014;"bearing witness"&#x2014;was to become the testimony of an age. This is related to what might be called"the Christian quandary" or Silone&#x2019;s"wrestling with the Lord." He refused to take the more facile path of an easy atheism or agnosticism. Christianity for Silone was both a historical movement, tied to a certain place and time, and a transcendent, timeless moral force. This conflicting tension between an adamant historicism and a desire for transcendence are ever-present in his thought and writing. Silone and his main protagonists are not so much searching for a hidden God as being hounded by the Lord. A doggedly persistent deity haunts Silone and his characters, seeking them out in desolate landscapes and humble farmhouses, donkey stalls, and empty churches. The moral and ethical impetus is more St. Augustine&#x2019;s Confessions than Beckett&#x2019;s Waiting for Godot. There is, as Irving Howe noted, an irreducible tension in all of Silone&#x2019;s writings between the secular promise of Socialist liberation and the Christian promise of spiritual transcendence. Despite his identification with both Christianity and socialism, Silone indelibly defined himself as"a Socialist without a Party, a Christian without a Church." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Silone was honest enough to recognize the potential and contemporary failure of the Catholic church just as he fearlessly recognized the potential and failure of orthodox Marxism. There was no Dantean"comedic" vision of Christianity in Silone; he confessed to being an"absurd Christian." Theologically, orthodox Christianity cannot accept absurdity or nihilism, yet for Silone, these must be confronted before they can be transcended. For Silone, the promise of Christianity as embodied in the Easter Resurrection has not come to pass. Instead, for the peasants of...</p><h2>From Modern Production to Imagined Primitive: The Social World of Coffee from Papua New Guinea</h2><p>In this vivid ethnography, Paige West tracks coffee as it moves from producers in Papua New Guinea to consumers around the world. She illuminates the social lives of the people who produce coffee, and those who process, distribute, market, and consume it. The Gimi peoples, who grow coffee in Papua New Guinea&#39;s highlands, are eager to expand their business and social relationships with the buyers who come to their highland villages, as well as with the people working in Goroka, where much of Papua New Guinea&#39;s coffee is processed; at the port of Lae, where it is exported; and in Hamburg, Sydney, and London, where it is distributed and consumed. This rich social world is disrupted by neoliberal development strategies, which impose prescriptive regimes of governmentality that are often at odds with Melanesian ways of being in, and relating to, the world. The Gimi are misrepresented in the specialty coffee market, which relies on images of primitivity and poverty to sell coffee. By implying that the &#34;backwardness&#34; of Papua New Guineans impedes economic development, these images obscure the structural relations and global political economy that actually cause poverty in Papua New Guinea.</p><p><p>Paige West is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Barnard College, Columbia University. She is the author of <i>Conservation Is Our Government Now: The Politics of Ecology in Papua New Guinea</i>, also published by Duke University Press, and a co-founder and co-editor of the journal <i>Environment and Society</i>.</p>"Coffee is a global and of course a ubiquitous commodity. And here lies its analytical challenge: how to grasp the full complexity of a drug whose path from production to consumption entails a world of enormous semiotic, cultural, institutional, political, economic, and ecological complexity. Paige West takes us deep into the heart of coffee's image world, as a spectacle, as a brand, and as a carrier of forms of certified value. But she also pursues the bean into the highlands of Papua New Guinea, where the crop, paradoxically, has little cultural value, and through the global supply chains of corporate shippers and processors. Here is an ethnography which exposes our morning cappuccino to the bright light of modernity. <i>From Modern Production to Imagined Primitive </i>does for coffee what Sidney Mintz in <i>Sweetness and Power</i> did for sugar: here in short is a meditation on caffeine and power."&#x2014;<b>Michael Watts</b>, Chancellor's Professor, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"Paige West writes against two kinds of flatness: the flatness of commodity chain studies and the flatness of ethical consumption's marketing spin. She offers, instead, a richly peopled ethnographic account of coffee's trajectory through time, space, lives, and imaginations, and takes us deep into the contradictory heart of our neoliberal times. Penetrating, provocative, and moving, this is an excellent read."&#x2014;<b>Tania Murray Li</b>, University of Toronto<br><br>&#x201c;Although many anthropologists have traced paths traveled by speci?c commodities around the world, no study can match the ambition and sweep of Paige West&#x2019;s book. (Daniel Reichman <i>American Anthropologist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A very powerful account of contemporary Papua New Guinea and global capitalism. It critically examines the fantasy images so known to us through popular media and advertising of commodities and shows how very real consequences these fantasies have. Written in an extremely clear and vivid style, the book makes excellent reading for courses on environmental anthropology, neoliberalism and Papua New Guinea. It critically examines the seemingly well meaning certification schemes, which raise questions among both academics and consumers alike, and this should allow for a wide-based readership. Finally, it simply is a very solid and well written ethnography based on long periods of fieldwork, which gives a thorough account of global coffee markets.&#x201d; (Tuomas Tammisto <i>Oceania</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This well-written ethnography contributes to several bodies of literature including those on coffee production and commodity chain studies, and ethnographic accounts from Papua New Guinea. It would be useful for graduate or undergraduate courses on globalization, as an example in graduate courses on writing ethnography, and for those scholars studying commodity chains and third-party certification systems.&#x201d; (Rebecca Mari Meuninck <i>American Ethnologist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Readers must be grateful for this &#x2018;rich&#x2019; look at the Gimi people and for West&#x2019;s challenge to analyze the images attached to them and to coffee.&#x201d;&nbsp; (Robert W. Thurston <i>Social Analysis</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This fine study could be useful in anthropology courses, area studies of Pacific culture, and courses on food studies, as well as a satisfying accompaniment to many hot cups of coffee.&#x201d; (Larry Lake <i>Contemporary Pacific</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;West provides an excellent ethnography that covers a wide variety of issues regarding coffee production in Papua New Guinea. Her analyses are complex and her research detailed. This work is of great value to increasing our understanding of Papua New Guinea as well as the creation of the imagined primitive in order to sell coffee.&#x201d;&nbsp; (Amy E. Harth <i>Electronic Green Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;West balances vivid description with thoughtful analysis throughout, avoiding the temptation to oversimplify the complex and often contradictory ways in which coffee helps shape people&#x2019;s lives...I found <i>From Modern Production to Imagined Primitive</i> both engaging and thought-provoking.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Hilary Howes <i>Southeast Asian Studies</i>)<br><br>"A book that has as its main themes criticisms of neoliberal economics and fair trading could have been rather dull. But Paige West brings these themes to life by using her ethnographic skills to meet and talk with the growers, the buyers, the traders in PNG and overseas and the coffee shop owners."

The Katy Forest massacre, in which 15,000 Polish officers held by the Bolsheviks were shot by the NKVD, has become the ``complex symbol of Polish suffering at the hands of Stalin,'' argues Paul, who began his research at the Center for European Studies in Bologna, Italy, under the auspices of Johns Hopkins Univ. School of Advanced International Studies. Using US Congressional testimony released only in 1989, buttressed by extensive interviews with survivors, Paul claims to present the most definitive view to date of Katy, blending historical reportage with narratives of three families caught up in Stalin's crimes. Indeed, for 50 years the story was buried not only by the Soviets but by Western governments, which concealed knowledge of Soviet guilt to protect their relationships with the USSR. Paul presents evidence of Stalin's one-word written order, ``Liquidate,'' which led to the murders, then details Soviet attempts to deny knowledge of the atrocity and, later, to blame the Nazis for it (after the Germans discovered some of the mass graves, the Nazis sought to propagandize the crime in order to divide the Allies). According to Paul, Stalin even manipulated the discovery ``to deal the legitimate government of Poland a lethal blow'' and set up a puppet regime. Moreover, Paul says, during the war years, the Soviets deported to Siberia and other harsh climes more than a million middle-class Poles, many of whom ``perished from starvation, forced labor and neglect.'' Well researched and ably written: a fine and harrowing study. (Eight-page photo insert--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For legions of country music fans, Randy Owen is a household name. Alabama has had 42 #1 hit singles and has sold more than 73 million records worldwide. In 1999 they were named the &#39;Country Group of the Century&#39; by the Recording Industry Association of America and inducted into The Country Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Alabama is one of the 20 best-selling music acts of all time-in the U.S. alone, they have sold more albums than Eric Clapton or Bob Dylan. Randy will be touring all of 2008 with his new 10 piece band to support his debut solo album releasing May 20th, 2008. Randy&#39;s music comes from his heart and his small town roots. He was raised in rural Alabama and grew up working on a small share-cropper farm and today lives on this same land that his family worked for generations. BORN COUNTRY--which is also the title of one of the group&#39;s first #1 hits, a country music classic--will weave in the Alabama story, Randy&#39;s own experiences with temptation in the face of superstar status, and how he held on to his traditional, Christian values over time. An inspirational story about how a poor country boy became a country music hero to millions of fans, the book will reveal never before shared material about Randy&#39;s close relationship with his father, his troubled teen years, and how his down-home country roots kept him grounded. Each chapter begins with Randy&#39;s lyrics to an Alabama song that sets up the stories of his life, instantly connecting readers with their favorite songs and the man behind the music.<p>For over twenty-five years Randy Owen was the front man and lead vocalist of Alabama, one of the most prolific groups in the history of music and the biggest country music group of all time. The band has had twenty-one gold, platinum, and multiplatinum albums and forty-two number one singles, and has sold more than 73 million albums. In November 2005, Randy and his Alabama band mates received country music's highest honor when they were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

Bringing together ideas of beauty from both Eastern and Western philosophy, Jullien challenges the assumptions underlying our commonly agreed upon definition of what is beautiful and offers a new way of beholding art.&nbsp;Jullien argues that the Western concept of beauty was established by Greek philosophy and became consequently embedded within the very structure of European languages. And due to its relationship to language, this concept has determined ways of thinking about beauty that often go unnoticed or unchecked in discussions of Western aesthetics. Moreover, through globalization, Western ideals of beauty have even spread to cultures whose ancient traditions are based upon radically different aesthetic foundations; yet, these cultures have adopted such views without question and without recognizing the cultural assumptions they contain.&nbsp;Looking specifically at how Chinese texts have been translated into Western languages, Jullien reveals how the traditional Chinese refusal to isolate or abstract beauty is obscured in translation in order to make the works more understandable to Western readers. Creating an engaging dialogue between Chinese and Western ideas, Jullien reasseses the essence of beauty.<p></p></p><p><b>Fran�ois Jullien</b> is professor at Universit� Paris Diderot, a member of the Institut universitaire de France, and director of the Institut de la pens�e contemporaine.

Courant and Hilbert&#39;s treatment restores the historically deep connections between physical intuition and mathematical development, providing the reader with a unified approach to mathematical physics. The present volume represents Richard Courant&#39;s second and final revision of 1953.</p><p><b>David Hilbert</b> (1862 - 1943) received his PhD from the University of K�nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) in 1884. He remained there until 1895, after which he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of G�ttingen. He held this professorship for most of his life. Hilbert is recognized as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries. His own discoveries alone would have given him that honour, yet it was his leadership in the field of mathematics throughout his later life that distinguishes him. Hilbert's name is given to Infinite-Dimensional space, called Hilbert space, used as a conception for the mathematical analysis of the kinetic gas theory and the theory of radiations.<br><br><b>Richard Courant</b> (1888 - 1972) obtained his doctorate at the University of G�ttingen in 1910. Here, he became Hilbert's assistant. He returned to G�ttingen to continue his research after World War I, and founded and headed the university's Mathematical Institute. In 1933, Courant left Germany for England, from whence he went on to the United States after a year. In 1936, he became a professor at the New York University. Here, he headed the Department of Mathematics and was Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences - which was subsequently renamed the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Among other things, Courant is well remembered for his achievement regarding the finite element method, which he set on a solid mathematical basis and which is nowadays the most important way to solve partial differential equations numerically.</p><h2>The Clinical Interview of the Child</h2><p><p>Ideal for both novices and advanced practitioners, the new edition of Stanley Greenspan's classic guide outlines a practical process for observing and interviewing children -- and organizing and interpreting their unfolding communications.</p><p>Highly acclaimed, The Clinical Interview of the Child uses actual interviews with children to show readers how to Apply a developmental, biopsychosocial framework for understanding the inner lives of children at different ages and stages Observe and assess human development, including emotional and cognitive patterns and perceptual capacities Help infants and children to reveal their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors during the clinical interview Organize and interpret the interview data by constructing a developmental profile and translating it into DSM-IV-TR diagnostic categories </p><p>The third edition has been expanded and revised extensively, with updated theoretical and conceptual foundations; information on higher levels of ego development and reflective and thinking capacities of older children; and a new section on a developmental biopsychosocial model -- the developmental, individual-difference, relationship-based (DIR) approach.</p><p>An invaluable educational and practical resource, The Clinical Interview of the Child, Third Edition, is an ideal tool for psychiatrists and psychologists, pediatricians, educators, social workers, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, and judges and attorneys dealing with children and families.</p></p><p><p>Stanley I.

It is at those moments that one best listens in on an expert at work. For the child and adolescent psychiatrist just starting out, these vignettes are true pearls to apply."-- "Sonya Marie Vieira, M.D. and A. Reese Albright, M.D., Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry", "January 2005"<br><br></p><p>"This beautifully lucid volume provides the best guide I know for assessing and understanding the developing child in all the dimensions of mental life and behavior. In the grand tradition of Anna Freud, Erikson, Mahler and Piaget, Greenspan's developmental structural approach provides a nuanced and in-depth practical method for assessing the child at every stage of development, emphasizing the unevenness of developmental levels. Greenspan's view is compatible with all the major contemporary theoretical points of view--cognitive, psychodynamic, behavioral, and relational--subsuming them in his objective descriptions. While the book is specifically aimed at the child clinician, those of us who treat adult patients will be hugely informed by this map of child development. The clinical vignettes are compelling. This is a superb how-to-do-it book, as well as one of the best introductions to the theory of mental development that I know. The biopsychosocial model of psychiatry, so often talked about but so little implemented, is here carried out splendidly."-- "Arnold Cooper, M.D., Past President, American Psychoanalytic Association, Stephen P.

In <i>Evocative Objects</i>, Turkle collects writings by scientists, humanists, artists, and designers that trace the power of everyday things. These essays reveal objects as emotional and intellectual companions that anchor memory, sustain relationships, and provoke new ideas.These days, scholars show new interest in the importance of the concrete. This volume's special contribution is its focus on everyday riches: the simplest of objects&#x2015;an apple, a datebook, a laptop computer&#x2015;are shown to bring philosophy down to earth. The poet contends, "No ideas but in things." The notion of evocative objects goes further: objects carry both ideas and passions. In our relations to things, thought and feeling are inseparable.</p><p>Whether it's a student's beloved 1964 Ford Falcon (left behind for a station wagon and motherhood), or a cello that inspires a meditation on fatherhood, the intimate objects in this collection are used to reflect on larger themes&#x2015;the role of objects in design and play, discipline and desire, history and exchange, mourning and memory, transition and passage, meditation and new vision.In the interest of enriching these connections, Turkle pairs each autobiographical essay with a text from philosophy, history, literature, or theory, creating juxtapositions at once playful and profound. So we have Howard Gardner's keyboards and Lev Vygotsky's hobbyhorses; William Mitchell's Melbourne train and Roland Barthes' pleasures of text; Joseph Cevetello's glucometer and Donna Haraway's cyborgs. Each essay is framed by images that are themselves evocative. Essays by Turkle begin and end the collection, inviting us to look more closely at the everyday objects of our lives, the familiar objects that drive our routines, hold our affections, and open out our world in unexpected ways.</p></p><p>Sherry Turkle is Abby Rockefeller Mauz� Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at MIT and Founder and Director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self.

Each chapter is alive with the subjects that most occupy our minds: sex, mating, getting along, getting ahead, friends, enemies, and social hierarchies. Why is child abuse 40 times more prevalent among step-families than biologically intact families? Why, according to one study, did 75% of men but 0% of women consent to have sex with a complete stranger? Buss explores these intriguing quandaries with his vision of psychology in the new millenium as a new science of the mind. <b> </b> Anyone with an interest in the biological facets of human psychology will find this a fascinating read.</p><p>David M.

Volume 2: 1940-1955</h2><p>Charlotte Perriand is among the foremost figures in twentieth-century interior design. Together with her contemporaries and collaborators Pierre Jeanneret and Le Corbusier, she created many pieces of furniture we now consider classics, including the instantly recognizable LC4 chaise. Her pioneering work with metal was particularly instrumental in paving the way for the machine-age aesthetic popular throughout the 1920s and &#x2019;30s.<br><br> The second volume in a planned four-part series, this lavish book covers the years between 1940 and 1955. Beginning in the 1940s, Perriand traveled extensively in Japan by invitation of the Japanese government with whom she worked as an advisor to modernize the country&#x2019;s design.

Remonstrating with her husband, Jack, that she had only three rooms and a kitchen instead of "a whole house," she was informed that "women are not reckoned in at all in the War Department," which also failed to appreciate that "'lieutenants' wives needed quite as much as colonels&#x2019; wives." In fact, Martha had only a short time to enjoy her new quarters, for in June her husband&#x2019;s regiment was ordered to Arizona, "that dreaded and then unknown land."&nbsp;Although Martha Summerhayes&#x2019;s recollections span a quarter of a century and life at a dozen army posts, the heart of this book concerns her experiences during the 1870s in Arizona, where (as Dan L. Thrapp observes in his introduction) the harsh climate and "perennial natural inconveniences from rattlesnakes to cactus thorns and white desperadoes, all made [it] a less than desirable posting for the married man and his wife." First privately printed in 1908, Vanished Arizona was so well-received that in 1910 Mrs. Summerhayes prepared a new edition (reprinted here), which was published in 1911, the year of her death. Among "the essential primary records of the frontier-military West," the book "retains its place securely because of the narrative skill of the author, her delight in life&#x2014;all life, including even, or perhaps principally, army life and people&#x2014;and because it is such a joy to read.</p><p>In 1874, when Martha Summerhayes came as bride to Fort Russell In Wyoming Territory, she &#39;saw not much in those first few days besides bright buttons, blue uniforms, and shinning swords, &#39; but soon enough the hard facts of army life began to intrude.In his introduction, Dan L.

Thus, a section has been added presenting Ehrenpreis' ``fundamental principle'' in full. The local arguments in this section are closely related to the proof of the coherence of the sheaf of germs of functions vanishing on an analytic set. Also added is a discussion of the theorem of Siu on the Lelong numbers of plurisubharmonic functions. Since the L2 techniques are essential in the proof and plurisubharmonic functions play such an important role in this book, it seems natural to discuss their main singularities.<br><br></p><p><p>"...third edition of this well-known, self-contained exposition of complex analysis from point of view of the theory of partial differential equations..." <b>--Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</b></p> <p>"...this new edition ... remains a basic reference and compulsory reading for the new generations of complex analysts." <b>--Revue Roumaine de Math�matiques Pures et Appliqu�es</b> </p></p><h2>Their Eyes Were Watching God: A Novel</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A deeply soulful novel that comprehends love and cruelty, and separates the big people from the small of heart, without ever losing sympathy for those unfortunates who don&#x2019;t know how to live properly.&#x201d; &#x2014;Zadie Smith</p><p>One of the most important and enduring books of the twentieth century, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God </em>brings to life a Southern love story with the wit and pathos found only in the writing of Zora Neale Hurston. Out of print for almost thirty years&#x2014;due largely to initial audiences&#x2019; rejection of its strong black female protagonist&#x2014;Hurston&#x2019;s classic has since its 1978 reissue become perhaps the most widely read and highly acclaimed novel in the canon of African-American literature.</p></p><p>At the height of the Harlem Renaissance during the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston was the preeminent black woman writer in the United States. She was a sometime-collaborator with Langston Hughes and a fierce rival of Richard Wright. Her stories appeared in major magazines, she consulted on Hollywood screenplays, and she penned four novels, an autobiography, countless essays, and two books on black mythology. Yet by the late 1950s, Hurston was living in obscurity, working as a maid in a Florida hotel. She died in 1960 in a Welfare home, was buried in an unmarked grave, and quickly faded from literary consciousness until 1975 when Alice Walker almost single-handedly revived interest in her work. <p> Of Hurston's fiction, <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> is arguably the best-known and perhaps the most controversial. The novel follows the fortunes of Janie Crawford, a woman living in the black town of Eaton, Florida. Hurston sets up her characters and her locale in the first chapter, which, along with the last, acts as a framing device for the story of Janie's life. Unlike Wright and Ralph Ellison, Hurston does not write explicitly about black people in the context of a white world--a fact that earned her scathing criticism from the social realists--but she doesn't ignore the impact of black-white relations either: </p><blockquote> It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. </blockquote> One person the citizens of Eaton are inclined to judge is Janie Crawford, who has married three men and been tried for the murder of one of them. Janie feels no compulsion to justify herself to the town, but she <i>does</i> explain herself to her friend, Phoeby, with the implicit understanding that Phoeby can "tell 'em what Ah say if you wants to. Dat's just de same as me 'cause mah tongue is in mah friend's mouf." <p> Hurston's use of dialect enraged other African American writers such as Wright, who accused her of pandering to white readers by giving them the black stereotypes they expected. Decades later, however, outrage has been replaced by admiration for her depictions of black life, and especially the lives of black women. In <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> Zora Neale Hurston breathes humanity into both her men and women, and allows them to speak in their own voices. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>One of the most important works of twentieth-century American literature, Zora Neale Hurston's beloved 1937 classic, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, is an enduring Southern love story sparkling with wit, beauty, and heartfelt wisdom. Told in the captivating voice of a woman who refuses to live in sorrow, bitterness, fear, or foolish romantic dreams, it is the story of fair-skinned, fiercely independent Janie Crawford, and her evolving selfhood through three marriages and a life marked by poverty, trials, and purpose. A true literary wonder, Hurston's masterwork remains as relevant and affecting today as when it was first published&#x2014;perhaps the most widely read and highly regarded novel in the entire canon of African American literature. </p></p><h2>The Thirty-Nine Steps</h2><p><b>Famous as the basis for several films, including the brilliant 1935 version directed by Alfred Hitchcock,&nbsp;<i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i>&nbsp;is a classic of early twentieth-century popular literature</b><br><br>Richard Hannay has just returned to England after years in South Africa and is thoroughly bored with his life in London. But then a murder is committed in his flat, just days after a chance encounter with an American who had told him about an assassination plot that could have dire international consequences. An obvious suspect for the police and an easy target for the killers, Hannay goes on the run in his native Scotland where he will need all his courage and ingenuity to stay one step ahead of his pursuers.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

David Robb stars as Hannay and Doctor Who&#x2019;s Tom Baker plays his ally Sir Walter Bullivant, in this recording which pays homage to the classic Hitchcock film.John Buchan wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps while he was seriously ill at the beginning of the First World War. In it he introduces his most famous hero, Richard Hannay, who, despite claiming to be an &#39;ordinary fellow&#39;, is caught up in the dramatic race against a plot to devastate the British war effort.</p><h2>Photography: A Middle-Brow Art</h2><p>The everyday practice of photography by millions of amateur photographers may seem to be a spontaneous and highly personal activity. But France's leading sociologist and cultural theorist Pierre Bourdieu and his research associates show that few cultural activities are more structural and systematic than photography. This perceptive and wide-ranging analysis of the practice of photography reveals the logic implicit in this cultural field. For some social groups, photography is primarily a means of preserving the present and reproducing moments of collective celebration, whereas for other groups it is the occasion of an aesthetic judgment in which photographs are endowed with the dignity of works of art. Bourdieu and his associates examine the socially differentiated forms of photographic practice by drawing on the results of surveys and interviews and by analyzing the attitudes and characteristics of both amateur and professional photographers. First published n 1965, <i>Photography</i> provides an excellent opportunity to observe key parts of Bourdieu's theories at a formative stage. Ideas that will become central to his thought&#x2015;the <i>habitus</i>, the structuring of taste by class position, people's use of taste to distinguish themselves from the classes to which they are adjacent, and the internalization of objective probabilities&#x2015;make an early appearance here. It is the first study to integrate survey research and anthropological observation in the manner for which Bourdieu has become justly renowned.</p><p>&#x201c;It is one of only a few studies to apply the results of surveys and interviews to form an analysis from a social perspective. It is also important because it reveals aspects of Bourdieu&#x2019;s theories at an early stage.&#x201d;&#x2014;Choice<br>&#x201c;The significance of Bourdieu&#x2019;s work for American studies lies in his powerful argument about the social definitions of popular aesthetics. His insistence that even the most trivial photographs serve social functions can be extended beyond photography and, thus, should be of interest to any student of popular culture.&#x201d;&#x2014;American QuarterlyPierre Bourdieu is Professor of Sociology at the Coll�ge de France and Director of the Center for European Sociology at the �cole de Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales.</p><h2>Atlas of Osteopathic Techniques</h2><p><p><b>Atlas of Osteopathic Techniques</b> is the only comprehensive full-color atlas of osteopathic manipulative techniques currently available.

While museums across the United States are replicating these "Zen rock gardens" in their courtyards and miniature versions of the gardens are now office decorations, they remain enigmatic, their philosophical and aesthetic significance obscured. <i>Reading Zen in the Rocks</i>, the classic essay on the <i>karesansui</i> garden by French art historian Fran�ois Berthier, has now been translated by Graham Parkes, giving English-speaking readers a concise, thorough, and beautifully illustrated history of these gardens.<br><br>Berthier's guided tour of the famous garden of Ryoanji (Temple) in Kyoto leads him into an exposition of the genre, focusing on its Chinese antecedents and affiliations with Taoist ideas and Chinese landscape painting. He traces the roles of Shinto and Zen Buddhism in the evolution of the garden and also considers how manual laborers from the lowest classes in Japan had a hand in creating some of its highest examples. Parkes contributes an equally original and substantive essay which delves into the philosophical importance of rocks and their "language of stone," delineating the difference between Chinese and Japanese rock gardens and their relationship to Buddhism. Together, the two essays compose one of the most comprehensive and elegantly written studies of this haunting garden form.<br><br><i>Reading Zen in the Rocks</i> is fully illustrated with photographs of all the major gardens discussed, making it a handsome addition to the library of anyone interested in gardening, Eastern philosophy, and the combination of the two that the <i>karesansui</i> so superbly represents.<br><br>Praise for the French edition:<br><br>"A small book of rare depth, remarkably illustrated, on one of the most celebrated and beautiful rock gardens of the monasteries of Kyoto."&#x2014;<i>L'Humanit�</i><br><br>"Through <i>Le Jardin de Ryoanji</i>, Berthier teaches us to read the zen in the rocks, to discover the language offered by the garden at Ryoanji.

The text continues to provide a unique survey of psychology that meets three goals: to demonstrate the unity and diversity of psychology&#39;s subject matter, to illuminate the research process and its link to application, and to make the material challenging and thought-provoking yet easy to learn. Weiten accomplishes the successful balance of scientific rigor and a student-friendly approach through the integration of seven unifying themes, an unparalleled didactic art program, real-life examples, and a streamlined set of learning aids that help students see beyond research to big-picture concepts. Major topics typically covered in today&#39;s courses are included, such as evolutionary psychology, neuropsychology, biological psychology, positive psychology, applied psychology, careers, and multiculturalism and diversity.</p><p>Wayne Weiten is a graduate of Bradley University and received his Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Illinois, Chicago in 1981. He has taught at the College of DuPage and Santa Clara University, and currently teaches at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

Garner focuses on why students struggle and what teachers can do to help them become self-directed learners. Difficulty reading, remembering, paying attention, or following directions are not the reasons students fail but symptoms of the true problem: underdeveloped cognitive structures the mental processes necessary to connect new information with prior knowledge; organize information into patterns and relationships; formulate rules that make information processing automatic, fast, and predictable; and abstract generalizable principles that allow them to transfer and apply learning.<br><br>Each chapter focuses on a key cognitive structure and uses real-life accounts to illustrate how learners construct meaning by using recognition, memorization, conservation of constancy, classification, spatial orientation, temporal orientation, and metaphorical thinking. The author s simple techniques stress reflective awareness and visualization. It s by helping students to be conscious of what their senses are telling them, encouraging them to visualize the information for processing, and then prompting them to ask questions and figure out solutions on their own that teachers can best help students develop the tools they need to<br><br>* Gather, organize, and make sense of information,<br>* Become cognitively engaged and internally motivated to achieve, and<br>* Experience learning as a dynamic process of creating and changing.<br><br>Suggestions for using these techniques in daily classroom practice, advice on lesson planning for cognitive engagement, and guidelines for conducting reflective research expand this book s practical applications. Use it not only to help struggling students break through hidden barriers but to empower all students with tools that will last a lifetime.</p><p></p><h2>Monet and the Impressionists for Kids: Their Lives and Ideas, 21 Activities (6)</h2><p>A lifelong love of art is one of the greatest gifts an adult can bestow on a child&#x2014;and no period of art is better loved or more available to children than Impressionism. <i>Monet and the Impressionists for Kids</i> invites children to delight in Cassatt&#x2019;s mothers and children, Renoir&#x2019;s dancing couples, and Gaugin&#x2019;s island scenes; 21 activities explore Monet&#x2019;s quick shimmering brush strokes, Cezanne&#x2019;s brilliant rectangles of color, Seurat&#x2019;s pointillism, and Degas&#x2019; sculpture-like circles of dancers.

All of the individuals included (Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Mary Cassatt, Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat) showed their works at one or more of the Impressionist exhibitions of the 1870s and 1880s; consequently, the book includes some Post-Impressionists, but excludes others such as Vincent van Gogh. The chapters devoted to the artists will be especially useful to report writers. They contain both biographical information and discussions of the work. Sidebars relate anecdotes and quotes, discuss images, and mention other important individuals in the art world. Sabbeth also includes 21 appealing extension activities such as recipes, crafts, games, and writing suggestions. Quality color reproductions on glossy pages, and varied, attractive layouts add to the book. Unfortunately the "for kids" of the title is a bit off target; the text is written at a fairly high level and the primary audience will be those who no longer see themselves as children.

Barely educated and valued since childhood strictly for his labor, Ernaux's father had grown into a hard, practical man who showed his family little affection. Narrating his slow ascent towards material comfort, Ernaux's cold observation reveals the shame that haunted her father throughout his life. She scrutinizes the importance he attributed to manners and language that came so unnaturally to him as he struggled to provide for his family with a grocery store and cafe in rural France. Over the course of the book, Ernaux grows up to become the uncompromising observer now familiar to the world, while her father matures into old age with a staid appreciation for life as it is and for a daughter he cautiously, even reluctantly admires. <i>A Man's Place</i> is the companion book to her critically acclaimed memoir about her mother,<i> A Woman's Story</i>.</p><p>Born in 1940, ANNIE ERNAUX grew up in Normandy, studied at Rouen University, and began teaching high school.

As always, this naturalist author/artist has enhanced the basic lesson through his inclusion of plants, creatures, and rock formations that form a part of the animals' natural habitat. His carefully executed colored-pencil and watercolor illustrations, all unbordered double-page spreads, reflect his keen observations of nature and his fine artistic talent. Each of his creatures exhibits a distinct individualism, adding character to the realistic scenes. The short, simple, oversized text, one sentence or phrase to a page, succinctly describes the pictured activity without detracting from the eye-catching view. This slim volume will appeal to beginning readers and is a delightful lap book for preschoolers as well. --Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Pub.

We are entering a new era of human evolution with the advent of a technology called CRISPR, which allows scientists to modify our genes. Although CRISPR shows great promise for therapeutic use, it raises thorny ethical, legal, political, and societal concerns because it can be used to make permanent changes to future generations. What if changes intended for the good turn out to have unforeseen negative effects? What if the divide between the haves and have-nots widens as a result? Who decides whether we genetically modify human beings and, if so, how?</p><p>Fran�oise Baylis insists that we must all have a role in determining our future as a species. The scientists who develop and use genome-editing tools should not be the only ones making decisions about future uses of the technology. Such decisions must be the fruit of a broad societal consensus. Baylis argues that it is in our collective interest to assess and steer the development and implementation of biomedical technologies. Members of the public with different interests and diverse perspectives must be among the decision makers; only in this way can we ensure that societal concerns are taken into account and that responsible decisions are made. We must be engaged and informed, think critically, and raise our voices as we create our future together.</p><p>Sharp, rousing, timely, and thought-provoking, <i>Altered Inheritance</i> is essential reading. The future of humanity is in our hands.</p></p><p>Fran�oise Baylis is University Research Professor at Dalhousie University.

I sleep better if I do my deep breathing every day. Sometimes I used to go for four or five nights with very little sleep -- that's murder. I was getting really depressed from a lack of sleep. But now my Yoga relaxes me so much that I not only sleep better at night, but I can nap in the afternoon, which I hadn't been able to do in years."</i><br><br> -- Helen Gould (age 64)<br><br><b>Breathing Techniques</b><br><br>Breathing techniques are one of the most helpful aspects of Easy Does It Yoga. Attention to breathing can add years to your life as well as greatly improving the quality of your life right now. Breath is vital for life, yet, perhaps because breathing is so automatic, we often give it little consideration. Unless we are faced with a serious respiratory condition such as asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, or pneumonia, we take our breathing for granted.<br><br>Most people breathe with only the upper third of their lungs, resulting in an inefficient exchange of oxygen and other gases in the body. The breathing exercises in Easy Does It Yoga retrain your body to use your lungs to their fullest capacity. Many of our students tell us that breathing exercises are their favorite part of the course, and they do them while watching television, walking, bathing, or even lying in bed. Breathing techniques can be used to lessen insomnia and to reduce the effects of upsetting emotions such as anxiety or anger. They can also help regulate blood pressure. Some of the common problems associated with aging, such as confusion, memory loss, depression, and fatigue, can also be helped by your learning to breathe more deeply.<br><br>Here's why: Inactivity contributes to the pattern of breathing more with the upper lung area than the lower, and this condition tends to worsen with age. Unfortunately, the blood vessels that pick up the oxygen accumulate more in the lower lung. As a result, the oxygen content of the blood tends to decrease with age. Since the brain requires three times as much oxygen as the rest of the body, it is affected most severely by lower blood levels of oxygen. This decreased oxygen level contributes to the confused, muddled thinking that sometimes accompanies aging. Lung efficiency normally decreases further when you lie down; nighttime confusion -- a common condition in which people wake during the night momentarily unable to remember where or who they are -- frequently results from a decrease in oxygen levels during sleep. The sluggish, depressed moods of many of our students disappear when they begin to breathe better. If you feel depressed upon waking, it may simply be due to reduced oxygen flow to your brain during the night.<br><br>Strengthening the muscles in the diaphragm and the abdomen brings each breath lower into the lungs where more of the blood circulates. You will learn to breathe easier, deeper, and slower, getting more of the fresh energy of life to the brain and body. <br><br>You will enjoy life more because your mind is brighter and more alert.<br><br>Some of the physical and mental benefits of Easy Does It Yoga breathing techniques are:<br><br><ul><br> <li><i>Increased strength:</i> Increases the strength of all the muscles and nerves used in breathing, including the diaphragm and the muscles between the ribs; strengthens back muscles; increases vigor.<br> </li><li><i>Greater limberness:</i> Increases the flexibility of the joints where the ribs join the breastbone in the front and the spine in the back.<br> </li><li><i>Greater vital capacity:</i> Increases the volume of air that one can breathe.<br> </li><li><i>Increased oxygen and energy levels:</i> Increases the amount of oxygen available to all parts of the body, raising energy levels.<br> </li><li><i>Easier breathing:</i> Lowers the respiration rate by deepening the air flow into the total lung space.<br> </li><li><i>Reduced heart strain:</i> Decreasing the number of breaths per minute and increasing oxygen supply reduces strain on the heart, helping to normalize blood pressure.<br></li></ul><br><br><i>"You can make yourself sick just by thinking, and a lot of these older people today, they get so despondent they just quit living. But not me -- I got it -- I get the benefit of this Yoga. Just don't overdo, that's all. Build up slowly and keep going, and sure enough you'll be compensated for your efforts. You'll feel more alive."</i><br><br> -- Gene Roy (age 62)<br><br><b>Relaxation and Meditation</b><br><br>Relaxation is a valuable tool that helps you eliminate accumulated tension and strain. Easy Does It Yoga teaches you how to visualize tension spots in different parts of your body and gently relax them. You can do this either sitting in a chair or lying in bed or on the floor. Practice the technique at various times during the day. It's especially useful when you are watching television or waiting for an appointment.<br><br>After you completely relax your body, meditation training takes over to relax and quiet your mind. This produces a state of deep silence and peace. Both of these practices improve concentration skills, memory, and self-esteem.<br><br>Some of the physical and mental benefits of relaxation and meditation training include:<br><br><ul><br> <li><i>Less tension and stress:</i> Shows you how to quiet your mind and relax tension in the body without medicine; helps to normalize blood pressure.<br> </li><li><i>Improved concentration and awareness:</i> Increases alertness and willpower; develops intuition.<br> </li><li><i>Increased coping skills:</i> Teaches you how to tolerate stress and create a more balanced outlook on daily frustrations.<br> </li><li><i>Reduced anxiety, irritability, and nervousness:</i> Shows you how to change your moods if you wish.<br> </li><li><i>Reduced dependence on medications or alcohol:</i> Encourages you to systematically relax yourself so you don't need to rely so much on self-medication.<br> </li><li><i>A positive self-image:</i> Improves your view of yourself; stimulates creative thought and intuition.<br> </li><li><i>Diminished fears:</i> Develops greater freedom from incapacitating fears, and shows you how to explore your full potential.<br> </li><li><i>Openness to new views:</i> Develops sensitivity to your inner being; creates greater feelings of connection to others and the world around you; provides strength and encouragement for you to explore your own ideas about life and your relationship to the world.<br></li></ul><br><br><i>"This Yoga was a blessing from God for me. I had been through seven operations and was on twenty-six pills a day for pain and depression. You name it. I told the doctor, 'Hey, I can't live like this. I've got to do something.' He said, 'Double the dose.' I came and told my wife, Mary, 'That's it.' I dumped all the pills in the toilet and flushed it. That was five years ago. I was so determined to be out of that condition. When I started this Yoga exercise there was some pain, sure, but nothing like what I'd already been through. Before this Yoga I never did any exercise at all. Now, hey, I feel so good. It's helped give me back ninety-nine and three-fourths percent of my life. I'm a new person!"</i><br><br>-- Gene Roy (age 62)<br><br><b>Nutrition</b><br><br>Many Americans eat a diet that is imbalanced and deficient in many essential nutrients. Our high-sugar, high-fat, and low-fiber diet is prematurely killing us. Overconsumption of saturated fats, cholesterol, sugar, salt, and alcohol has been correlated with six of the ten leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and cirrhosis of the liver. Making the problem worse, often older adults are especially attracted to high-fat, high-sugar diets because diminished senses of taste and smell make rich foods more appealing.<br><br>People of any age who feel listless and depressed due to inactivity, substance abuse, or convalescence tend to eat what is convenient and comforting rather than what is nutritious. Weight is also an increasing problem: Recent surveys show that over 40 percent of adults in the United States are overweight to a degree that may impair health and longevity. Underweight, and associated loss of appetite, are also a problem in some people. Both of these problems of imbalance can be corrected with proper nutrition.<br><br>Conditions such as obesity, osteoporosis, diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, anemia, constipation, and many nonspecific complaints such as confusion, poor appetite, melancholy, and listlessness can be improved when you change your diet following the guidelines in this book.<br><br>The nutritional suggestions that follow present an attractive alternative to our unhealthy American diet. Our suggestions are based on choosing more traditional foods -- foods that are less processed and with fewer added chemicals -- and preparing them more simply. Far from being a new "health food" diet, these suggestions resemble the way we ate before food technology became such a big business. In this book you will find a flexible diet substantially lower in fats and higher in unrefined carbohydrates than the average American diet. A diet higher in fresh or frozen fruits, vegetables, and grains and lower in processed or refined foods is healthier, cheaper, and lower in calories.<br><br>You will achieve a better diet as you learn:<br><br><ul><br> <li>How to recognize and purchase nutritious foods on a limited income.<br> </li><li>How to store and prepare foods for best nutritional value.<br> </li><li>How to recognize the most common nutritional diseases and what to do about them.<br> </li><li>How to supplement your diet wisely.<br></li></ul><br><br><b>Philosophy</b><br><br>Yoga is not based on any original book or scripture; instead, its precepts have been handed down orally from teacher to student for thousands of years. The goal of this philosophy is self-understanding and the development of a harmoniously balanced individual. The essence of Yoga philosophy is transformation.<br><br>The ideas and growth associated with Yoga have tremendous value for everyone. As you begin to know yourself better, your self-esteem and leadership abilities emerge. You will ultimately discover something at the very core of your being that does not change, or grow old. In Yoga this is called the Self, and it is considered to be the real support of the individual. As self-awareness grows, you become more resistant to the negative attitudes of depression, fear, and despair that are often associated with age or disability, and you will be able t...</p><h2>True Honor (Uncommon Heroes, Book 3)</h2><p>CIA officer Darcy St. James is after a man who knew September 11 would happen&#x2015;a man who chose to profit from the knowledge.

Dee is a lifelong resident of Illinois and is active online. Visit her at [www.deehenderson.com].This absorbing third entry in Henderson's Uncommon Heroes series exemplifies why Henderson, a wildly successful CBA novelist, is dominating this market's paperback fiction bestseller list. Darcy St. James, aka "Hound Dog," is a strong yet vulnerable retired top-notch spy for the CIA. When current events pull her back into active duty, her path crosses that of Chief Petty Officer and Navy SEAL Sam Houston, aka "Cougar." Their romance, while inevitable, is endearing; Sam has "always prayed to meet an interesting woman," and he finds one in Darcy. There's a bounty on Darcy's head, however, and the suspense builds as she eludes her attackers throughout the novel. Darcy is admirably cast as a strong, career-minded, middle-aged woman a combination that is rare in CBA novels. Henderson has conquered a problem she had with heavy dialogue in previous novels and also cut down on the dense military jargon without losing the flavor of the series. The story is chock-full of fresh details, fine descriptions and unexpected plot twists. It's not without pitfalls, however: the amount of Scripture swapping that goes on between Darcy and Sam may feel a bit awkward to all but the most hardcore evangelical reader, as will numerous italicized conversations with God. There are some unusual terms not referenced in the glossary ("chocolate chip cammies"); a retelling of September 11 is rather bland and emotionless; and the last chapter feels unnecessary. But overall, this novel is Henderson's best work to date.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All the Single Ladies: A Novel</h2><p><p>In this fast-paced and evocative novel, beloved <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Dorothea Benton Frank again takes us deep into the Lowcountry of South Carolina, where three unsuspecting women are brought together by tragedy and mystery</p><p>Lisa St. Clair knows a thing or two about weathering storms.

There have been more millionaires and indeed, billionaires, who have made their fortunes as a result of reading this success classic than any other book every printed. NAPOLEON HILLS&#39;s &#34;Think and Grow Rich&#34; is the authors most famous work. This is the COMPLETE Reference Book. A true masterpiece with the fundamentals of the Success philosophy. ***** ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Napoleon Hill was an American author who was one of the earliest producers of the modern genre of personal-success literature. His most famous work, Think and Grow Rich, is one of the best-selling books of all time. Hill&#39;s works examined the power of personal beliefs, and the role they play in personal success. &#34;What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve&#34; is one of Hill&#39;s hallmark expressions. How achievement actually occurs, and a formula for it that puts success in reach for the average person, were the focal points of Hill&#39;s books. ****** Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, about &#34;Think and Grow Rich&#34;: Think and Grow Rich is a motivational personal development and self-help book written by Napoleon Hill and inspired by a suggestion from Scottish-American businessman Andrew Carnegie. While the title implies that this book deals only with how to get rich, the author explains that the philosophy taught in the book can be used to help people succeed in all lines of work and to do or be almost anything they want. For instance, Jim Murray (sportswriter) wrote that Think and Grow Rich was credited for Ken Norton&#39;s boxing upset of Muhammad Ali in 1973. The Reverend Charles Stanley writes &#34;I began to apply the principles of (Think and Grow Rich) to my endeavors as a pastor, and I discovered they worked!&#34; The book was first published during the Great Depression. At the time of Hill&#39;s death in 1970, Think and Grow Rich had sold 20 million copies. It remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill&#39;s books - a perennial best-seller after 70 years (BusinessWeek Magazine&#39;s Best-Seller List ranked Think and Grow Rich as the sixth best-selling paperback business book 70 years after it was first published). Think and Grow Rich is listed in John C. Maxwell&#39;s A Lifetime &#34;Must Read&#34; Books List. The text of Think and Grow Rich is founded on Hill&#39;s earlier work The Law of Success, the result of more than twenty years of research based on Hill&#39;s close association with a large number of individuals who achieved great wealth during their lifetimes. At Andrew Carnegie&#39;s bidding, Hill studied the characteristics of these achievers and developed 16 &#34;laws&#34; of success intended to be applied by anybody to achieve success. Think and Grow Rich condenses these laws further and provides the reader with 13 principles in the form of a philosophy of personal achievement. It is noted in the book, that an individual with desire, faith, and persistence can reach great heights by eliminating all negative energy and thoughts and focusing at the greater goals in hand.</p><p>This original version of THINK AND GROW RICH from our publishing boutique, Black Swan Publishing, Atlanta Georgia is the best version to capture the full message and philosophy of this timeless book.

Kin to star and stone, water and wind, the practitioner of Green magic respects the powers and spirits of nature, and knows how to work with their energies to accomplish magical goals.</p> <p>This comprehensive guide to the Green Craft focuses specifically on the magical practices covered in the three volumes of Green Witchcraft&#x2015;and goes even further, presenting information not found in any other book.

It comes from the ancient pagans, who relied on the natural world--using herbs, faeries, wind, rain, and fire--to create spells, potions, and healing teas. "The Green Witch is a Natural Witch, a Hereditary Witch, a Kitchen Witch, a Cottage Witch, a Hedge Witch ... and generally a Solitary Witch," she explains, hoping to demystify this sacred, yet highly accessible craft. In her previous books (among them <i>Green Witchcraft</i> and <i>Green Witchcraft III</i>) Moura offers manuals devoted to mastering specific spells, such as alter-making and potions. In <i>Green Magic</i> she takes a more philosophical approach, delving into the psychology, ethics, and traditions of this earth-based craft. For instance, she offers a section on "transference magic," which warns practitioners to keep close tabs on the unconscious mind so as not to subconsciously transfer negative energy to other people when trying to cast goodwill spells. Those who need basic instruction will find some practical advice here, such as the use of "ritual jewelry" and making magical herbal teas, but mostly this stands out as the deeper discussion that advanced witches yearn for once they pass Green Witchcraft 101. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p><strong>Ann Moura</strong> has been a practitioner of Green Witchcraft for over forty years. She holds both a B.A. and an M.A. in History. Moura lives in Florida where she runs her own metaphysical store, presents public rituals, and teaches classes on the Craft.

Edgar Garcia intervenes with a poetic experiment: Every night of the three months of Columbus&#x2019;s first voyage to the Americas, Garcia read his corresponding journal entry before sleep. Asleep, his mind sutures displacements, migrations, and restorations into an assemblage of hemispheric becoming.</strong></p><p><strong>Edgar Garcia </strong>is part of an exciting new cohort of Greater American poets (those who cast a revealing light on the hemisphere from Alaska to the tip of Patagonia) who are working towards decoding &amp; re-coding multi-metrical conceptions of historical space-time with the intent of reinvigorating political agencies. <em>Skins of Columbus </em>is a virtuosic exfoliation of nested chronicles that give voice to the heterogeneous temporalities that make for &#x201c;the people.&#x201d; This is a maximalist poetics. Garcia spares no formalistic strategy to explore the chasm between said people and their &#x201c;story.&#x201d; If the Greater American, Greater African, Greater European, Greater Oceanic and Greater Asian poetics stay on track and avoid the pitfalls of overt (or covert) ethno-nationalism, while critically flushing out their respective mythical terrains, we might just arrive at a genuinely new understanding of The Globe&#x2019;s Inherent Potential. And what could be more pressing right now than that? &#x2015;<strong>Rodrigo Toscano </strong></p><p><strong>Edgar Garcia </strong>comes through with a counter-chronicle of conquest. He shows us how skins are like masks the poet and storyteller puts on and takes off, most especially when engaged with epic histories and the myths therein, changing places, changing times, and of course, changing us. &#x2015;<strong>Michael Taussig</strong></p><p><strong>Good morn or evening, friends</strong>. You should feel good right now because Edgar Garcia plays the <em>Skins of Columbus </em>inside out, inducing the kind of &#x201c;speech-like movements of leg and hip&#x201d; that can get you swallowed and put away, which ought to make you not feel so good. This book is ravishing and ravaging, and/or wants to be, which is troubling, though that is as it should be. <strong>Can we dream ourselves inside out of what consumes and abandons us?</strong> This question, which bears the world&#x2019;s disaster, is our nightmare, though we are starving, even abandon having been tainted. Projection, ingestion, rejection and introjection merge in the mirror of constantly midnight, brutally Christian profligacies of diary, conquest, denial and refreshment. Meanwhile, over and over, we sing &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Explain.&#x201d; We sing it to ourselves, about ourselves. They shit us and they shit on us and we shit ourselves. In this intestine battlefield and looking glass, Garcia sings all that, poetry and criticism haven gotten back together after many broken promises, in the breaking of many more, as the desire for subversion and embrace to get back together, too. Evidently, that reconciliation exceeds human possibility. Criticism affirms this negative condition, as Garcia sings, singing so he can see if&#x2015;violently, gorgeously, way more than humanly&#x2015;we can sing our way out of inside out. He&#x2019;s bone deep, and miles ahead, and just getting started. &#x2015;<strong>Fred Moten</strong></p><p><strong>Edgar Garcia </strong>is a scholar of hemispheric literatures and cultures of the Americas, principally of the 20th century.

What does a colon do, actually? Is rectum individual style? Is exposition of style colonoscopy? To explain: what follows is a book whose poems explore colonial myth. To explore the burrowing of our colonial myths in real-life experience&#x2015;wet violence in the tough skin of emblems and instincts&#x2015;the author spent four months reading the journal of Christopher Columbus before sleep. Later, he transformed his dreams into a poetic record of what his memory, in its half-sleep, had forgotten it remembered: the gash, shock, glamor, and spell of origins. It belonged to that history as intimately as that history belonged to the momentary constellations of a night sky. Its belonging, unclear and unassimilated, anacoluthic but self-instructive, is the shining of dark stars equipped with consciousness. To say simply that you could subvert Columbus and the world he left us only stages the inadequacy of the curse to do away with the accursed object. As usual, reality is contrary. The curse imprecates the curser, the interdict awakens the nightmare, iconoclasts are slaves of icons, and, truisms though these may be, you conjure yourself inside them constantly: to subvert is to crumble to the enterprise of memory overturned, to hurl body over the head of mental colony only to flip back upward, part to an assed whole. So the question, for you at least, is how to flip from realities different than those of the colonial myth&#x2015;to stay true to the reality of myth, which bakes the crust of your thought with its hot white light, while hitching somehow to new suns and ideas. How do you look inside yourself for its terrible illumination while shedding new light on that light? Could you, with mirror or sword-face even for an instant, blind the gods and their higher powers? To be clear: you are not looking for wisdom, but for a world unfolding for life. In October 2015, soon after moving to Chicago, you came up with a strategy for this. You came to it while browsing the yearly Hyde Park Used Book Sale, which takes place on Columbus Day weekend. In the chaotic pile of 30,000 books separated into 50 sections in Dole, Del Monte, and Chiquita produce boxes&#x2015;emanations of the United Fruit Company&#x2015;you came across a hardcover edition of Bartolom� de las Casas&#x2019;s sixteenth-century Journal of Christopher Columbus. Reading the entry for that day, the 10th, there amid the boxes and browsing shoppers, you saw the rain chop the waves, shake the whole history from inside out, and take you into the storm pulling his ship down the sea. In two days, he would see land. But, at that moment, he was in the darkest kind of sleep. So you decided to awaken with him, to see if you could see what your mind saw in what he saw and, maybe in doing so, to flash a mirror into the bleach-boiled eyes of the colonial sun. That night, and every night for the next three months during which he traveled the coasts, tricking history into his tasks, you read the journal before bed closely to have your sleeping mind think intently on its images, plots, symbols, motives, and feelings. You wished to see what, when left to its matrix of associations, your mind made of the colonial story. Notes throughout the night recorded your dreams. In the mornings, you made new notations to chart closer contacts between you two. You composed the text in the evenings, putting your dreams and the journal together into a new story of creation. What you made you now hold in your hands: the positions, spaces, and temporalities of history are tasks you gave yourself, entanglements warped in a structure that depends on you for its churn, unfolding, and thus instanced to modulate that which discloses itself nights and days. Here is a study about how language is captivated by and recaptures the negativity of the hemispheric experience surging from its southern sources, how its inconsistency and unevenness are stopgaps because in practice a body and its myth are not exclusive of one another, but reciprocal and dynamic, semiotic and aesthetic, signs and the instances in which they unravel themselves. Like a first being looking out from the gauzy green light of a newborn cosmos, you saw the gods then as so many cascading storms.

Your cousin has invited you to visit him and his cat in their home in one of the southeastern colonias. It was the start of the rainy season, so you time your daily weave across the city to avoid the storms rolling through in the afternoon and evening. On one of your outings you visit the national university, the fourth oldest in the Americas, where you snap a picture of the provost&#x2019;s office from across a greenish gauze of wet tropical trees and shrubbery. Lacking the uninterrupted confidence of a picture, a diary is desperate for its trace. It is anxious to make a mark from the pleated rocks, pyramids, personal moods, papers, and airs of the day. The history of Columbus&#x2019;s journal is awkward. The extant version is a pr�cis&#x2015;evidently faithful (excluding only navigational minutiae), made by de las Casas&#x2015;which incorporates first-person quotes from a copy of the original day-to-day log. Its shaky Spanish reflects de las Casas&#x2019; editorial commitment to originary dialectic, that is, either the Genoan&#x2019;s in a language foreign to him, or a semi-literate scribe&#x2019;s doing his best to write. Garbled tones also complicate who comes first. Columbus is writing to satisfy and elicit royal investments (so invites comparison of his journey to Marco Polo&#x2019;s); de las Casas is writing a history, and decidedly one to protect natives from exploitation (within the ethical ambits of Sirach 34:18-22); and the scribe was just laboring to keep whatever monad he had made for himself going (pace Leibniz, Deleuze, or otherwise). Damned, then, is the book from the outset; damned, because it is a diary in search of a body, a trace without interior. &#x201c;Damned,&#x201d; in the words of Aim� C�saire, &#x201c;because of the caravan of far-off interiors... Damned in the wake of world discoverers. Damned, because in the ears of the poet is re-attempted the same voice which haunted Columbus: &#x2018;I will found a new heaven and a new earth so wonderful that one will no longer think of who is to be first.&#x2019;&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t keep a diary. But, if I did, I think that what I would have written at that time about that moment looking across the quad at San Carlos University would have been thick with the obvious. Founded, like other colonial colleges, as a nest in which to hatch the doctrine of the cross and sword, by the twentieth century the campus was a natural environment for the violent conflict between popular socialist movements and the military juntas allied with American fruit companies. Nearby is buried the body of a K&#x2019;iche&#x2019; peasant who one day in 1980 protested the decades-long depredation of the Guatemalan Civil War. That night, he was burned, revived, kidnapped, tortured, and hurled from the balustrade of the university president&#x2019;s mansion. Occult little spot of land, learning, war, and terror, the campus gives no immediate impression that anyone has ever died there. Your cousin is placid about it all. Even though the publicized killing of your shared first cousin once removed&#x2015;while commanding a squadron of FAR, the Rebel Armed Forces&#x2015;forced your family to flee to Mexico, the United States, and Cuba, he tells you over drinks that things were bad then, sure... but not as bad as they are now. The wars for control of the fruit trade were nothing compared to those for control of the cocaine routes. In the banana republic there was a semblance of a republic. He says the image is evaporated, and the chaos of not seeing the enemy is much more real and much more terrifying. Going with the devil has its perks&#x2015;baroque profit is far more the horror. After the war ended, disaffected soldiers, death squads, and secret police abused the permeability of the state into a vast criminal enterprise, glamoring a hollow bureaucracy to serve the trafficking of drugs, arms, and workable bodies. So eviscerated is the civic apparatus today that citizens hire assassins and form lynch mobs to secure justice. While the country doesn&#x2019;t table as high as other murder capitals of the world (for instance, every year more people are killed per capita in Baltimore or St. Louis, let alone San Salvador or Caracas), it is one of the best places in the world to kill: &#x201c;ninety seven per cent of homicides remain unsolved,&#x201d; one investigative journalist writes, quoting a U.N. official, &#x201c;Guatemala is a good place to commit a murder, because you will almost certainly get away with it.&#x201d; From this vantage, the distant violence of the conquistadors is somehow akin, complete, condensed, retrograde. You finish your drinks and cruise the Avenida las Americas where you pass the city&#x2019;s bronze statue of Christopher Columbus. Devoid of subtlety, he perches on a globe wrapped in the Spanish coat of arms, carried by three African and Indian men. His grandeur is so cold, obvious, and sinewy, it is so much less real. Five years earlier in summer 2005, newly graduated from college, you wrote a long erotic historical poem designed to unmask the reality of the conquest. What you called your &#x201c;mytho-economic epic of the Americas&#x201d; desired to investigate how deep the lifeblood of the conquest flowed, like a myth or concept, in the everyday pulsing of your veins. In one bit of it you speak to Sim�n Bol�var&#x2015;the humanist liberator of Venezuela, Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Panama&#x2015;about the strange gods that preside over the violence of the continent&#x2019;s Olympus: In the tropical climates of Cuscatlan and Goathemala the sun at midday appears to draw the clouds around itself in serpentine designs, and from these signed snakes come the thunder, lightning, and rain and here I sat with Bolivar, Lord of the Face of Torches, who said to me: And we also have a dirty god about whom I could say nothing that isn&#x2019;t true; he lies, cheats, and steals; and when we met he was so faraway from everything I&#x2019;d known I&#x2019;ve probably hated him as much as I love him. His skin is blackened white from constant exposure to the sun; well traveled, his toothless gums protect those who foolishly wander to unknown wastes. Rather predictably, in the next section of the poem you wander through a smoking hole in the jungle to the underworld, where you speak to underbelly gods paranoid about their ever-slipping control of space and time. One god you meet is Camazotz, Lord of the House of Death Bats, who says, &#x201c;whoever fights a revolution ploughs the sea.&#x201d; You are meant to be unsure as to whether he sees himself as ocean or ploughman. Later, listening together to the sound of the sky between its cracking rains, he tells you about his exploits in the Guatemalan earthquake of Christmas 1917&#x2015;his smile is emerald green in the smoky cellar light&#x2015;when he covered the moon with a cloud of black wings to steal the head of the statue of Christopher Columbus. This actually happened. But the people had chosen their true god. After the quake, the Genoan&#x2019;s head was recovered and reattached. And who today knows Camazotz? If you look close, though, you will notice a scar that sutures the statue&#x2019;s neck in Guatemala City.

In order to understand the character and significance of the extreme psychological states the pharaoh experienced--states often involving perilous encounters with alternate realities--we need to approach them as spiritual and religious phenomena that reveal the extraordinary possibilities of human consciousness.

Indeed it was the popularity of the Geneva Bible, with its anti-royalist content, that eventually forced James I to sanction his own, pro-monarchy, translation.

McGrath's story begins with the development of the printing press, describes the forces (before, during, and after the Reformation) fueling the demand for English vernacular translations of the Bible, and considers the impact of the King James Version on Western worship and politics. McGrath deftly blends an arch and charming, donnish argot with breezy, tough, brass-tacks directness. Of the ongoing process of creating new biblical translations, he writes, "It has yet to end; indeed, it will not end, until either history is brought to a close or English ceases to be a living language." Elsewhere, describing the cultural influence of the Authorized Version, he explains, "Without the King James Bible, there would have been no <i>Paradise Lost</i>, no <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, no Handel's <i>Messiah</i>, no Negro spirituals, and no Gettysburg address.")

In this lively narrative romp, he tracks a group of baseball&#x2019;s biggest stars&#x2014;including Aaron Judge and J.D.

They are changing the way hitting is taught to players of all ages, and major league clubs are scrambling for their services, hiring them in record numbers as coaches and consultants.

As it was, three o'clock found me lifting the curtain to watch a red sleigh drawn by two black chargers skim down the hill to the harbor. The morning's clouds had long since streamed out to sea, leaving blue sky and four inches of new, wet snow blanketing all of Plymouth. The horses cast vaporous balloons to the air and flung up their heads as if intoxicated by the change in weather. Of the storm, only an ashen streak remained on the horizon, lying over the water like a bitter dream. That and the combers breaking in chalky ribbons against the wharf pilings. I let the curtain fall and turned in time to see Sophia bolt past my door in her chemise, dark hair flying."Sophia!" Fourteen, nearly grown, yet still wild as a colt, my niece was as much a trial to my sister, Lucy, as I'd been to our mother. With her long,sharp nose and gray eyes, she even resembled me. "Sophia, what sort of behavior is this?" I crossed to the doorway and regarded her with elaborate solemnity, though I had to master a smile to do so.Sophia stopped beneath the portrait of my father, which had hung in the same spot since it was painted ten years before his death. Her cheeks were a frenzy of red splotches. She dipped her chin and brought her index fingers together at her waist in a posture that she likely hoped I'd perceive as properly demure."Aunt Lydia?" She smiled up at me through long lashes. Practicing, no doubt. Before long, some young man would be the recipient of that look.I glanced at my father's likeness, to derive strength from the stern line of his mouth, his judging gaze. "If you expect to attend Mr. Emerson's lecture this afternoon, you must comport yourself as a lady," I said. "You are not a wild animal."Sophia bowed her head, yet I caught the pucker of agitation--of mischief even--upon her young brow.I stepped into the hall and said after her, "Ladies do not run down hallways half-dressed. Ladies walk with elegance and grace. Even when they're in a hurry.""Yes, Aunt Lydia.""Show me."Sophia closed her eyes and took four prim steps."No, no. That's not it at all. Look." I walked the length of the hall. My hem sighed over the carpet, my arms swung quietly against my skirts. I knew how it looked--it was plain in Sophia's admiring glance--I was gliding rather than walking. It appeared as if my slippers never touched the floor. It was an effect I'd spent years perfecting. I turned and walked back to her."Now you. Lengthen your neck--feel it stretch--and let your body hang from your shoulders. Look, imagine it as a bolt of fabric draped across your bones.""My <i>bones</i>?" My niece made a face."Your flesh is a kind of fabric, is it not?" I adjusted my sleeves at the wrist, and saw that a thread had come loose and the hem must soon be mended, a task I did not relish. "It ought to be cared for and worn with grace," I said. "Now you show me you've learned what I taught."Droplets of perspiration had dampened the tiny curls in front of her ears. I touched one and it wound instantly around my finger. "Show me," I said,dropping my hand to her shoulder and turning her so that I could observe her back as she walked obediently to the head of the stairs, where she turned and came back to me.I nodded. "Much better. You must practice every day. Do you still stand in the dancing stocks?""Sometimes.""Every day, Sophia. For thirty minutes every day."She nodded again but would not look at me and I knew her habits would not change. The only thing that could make a girl stand in the stocks was a lively and determined will."Surely you won't forbid me the lecture?" Her voice was anxious, ready to plummet toward despair should I deny her. "All Plymouth will be there! Everyone I know is going!""We do not attend lectures that we might be <i>seen,</i> Sophia," I admonished. "We go to <i>hear.</i> I've heard Mr. Emerson speak and I know he's a man of wisdom and intellect. His ideas are forward-thinking, and it behooves us to hear and understand them. But it is not a fashion show." My ears caught the scolding tone of my father's voice in mine, and I stopped. Hadn't I sworn that I would never speak to a child that way? Hadn't I cringed every time my father had bridled me with his hard tongue?Sophia bent her head again in a posture of penitent resignation, yet I saw that her toes were nearly dancing upon the floor, as if she could not control their expectancy.I instantly relented, for she reminded me so much of myself. "You may attend as long as you behave like a lady," I said. "Now go and get dressed. We must be at the meetinghouse in an hour."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I HAD CHOSEN my gray silk for the occasion, and had already laid it out on the bed. Though Lucy declared it out of fashion, with its pleated bodice and plain collar, it suited my taste as well as my principles. I'd long since abandoned interest in the whims of society, and settled on a simple and comfortable style without corsets or stays. I regarded simplicity as a virtue, one that encouraged clarity of thought and action.I took the pins from my hair and let it fall in heavy brown waves to my knees. Even at the age of thirty-three, I enjoyed letting it down, for it never failed to make me feel girlish and unencumbered. As I combed my hair, mygaze drifted around the room, lingering on my bookshelf. Goethe was my current favorite; the cover was already worn from the many times I'd read it since summer, when George Bradford gave it to me in appreciation for my contributions to his philosophy class. I had also read extensively in Swedenborg, the French philosopher on whose work Mr. Emerson was scheduled to speak that afternoon. I was eager to hear what he would say. My aunt Priscilla had lately charged me with Swedenborgian leanings, though I'd retorted smartly that I would never fall under the influence of any one philosopher.When I heard Mr. Emerson in Boston, I knew he was as great a philosopher as any I'd read. Yet it was not merely his thoughts that impressed me, but his mannerisms, which suggested a distinctive refinement education alone could not produce. He did not move his hands and arms in the great sweeping gestures so common to orators, but stood quite still, allowing his clear voice to persuade the audience. On the few occasions when he did lift his hand for emphasis, the effect was startling and forceful.The clock on the landing struck four and I came to myself, wondering what Mother would think of me, staring at a pile of books when I had so little time to prepare for the lecture. I could hear her voice in my ear, reminding me that punctuality was a courtesy that married trustworthiness to respect. I gathered my hair, rolled it up onto my head, secured it with combs, and studied the effect in the mirror.The face I saw there was unmistakably sad. My long chin and milky skin, my deep-set eyes, all hinted at some unnamed sorrow. I'd always believed my features too plain to attract notice, but now I considered that the fault might lie more in this melancholy gaze. I resolved to look more cheerful that evening.I removed my day gown and took my dress from the bed. The skirt swirled around me with a soft, gray hiss, like the sea upon the shore. Mother had insisted I wear such a dress to my first dance lesson when I was seven. It had been a blue silk gown with a white lace collar. I'd relished the sensation of the cool, slippery fabric against my arms and shoulders, though I did not want to attend the lessons. I believed dancing was one more severe restraint imposed on proper adult ladies. I'd been used to climbing trees and swinging on branches. Yet it was Mother's wish that both Lucy and I master all the womanly arts, and so once each week we walked up North Street to the Town Square. This duty soon became a privilege when my French dance master revealed that he was a distant cousin of Napoleon Bonaparte. I was immediately won over, for Napoleon was my hero.Monsieur Remy was a small man, only a few inches taller than I, with long, slender hands and auburn hair that fell to his shoulders. He favored bright colors and fine embroidery--though worn at the cuffs and collar, his waistcoats were always the latest fashion. Yet he never smiled. He regarded dancing with the same solemnity that my aunts viewed their Calvinist faith.I adored him.He taught me to carry myself like a princess. Each Wednesday morning Lucy and I appeared at his door, where we lifted the knocker shyly and waited for his white-haired housekeeper to grant us entrance. She never spoke to us, never once said our names, but smiled as she nodded us in and led us through the smoky kitchen. My heart never failed to race as I stepped into the cold room where Monsieur Remy waited.Though it was an empty bedchamber, to me it was a hall. The floorboards gleamed from the scouring of slippered feet. There were no drapes covering the room's three windows, so morning light drenched the walls and floor and expanded the empty room to grand proportions.Monsieur Remy was always there, standing at the window and looking out to sea, hands tucked neatly into the small of his back. On the first day he looked at me and, in an accent that melted the ends of his words, said, "You must submit each day to the discipline of the stocks. As soon as you start to dance, I will know if you've been faithful."The stocks were a single block of wood with back-to-back slots for the feet, so that when a dancer stood in them, her legs turned out and the backs of her heels touched. Lucy complained, but I stood in them every day for more than an hour. The pain always began slowly, deep inside my hips--from there it slid down to my knees, which began to throb after ten minutes. Then my calves protested and moments later my ankles as well, until I was encased in pain from the waist down. Yet I never avoided them. I bent my will to their iron discipline, for I loved dancing with all my heart.I practiced my steps for hours, urging my feet into the complex patterns, positioning my body with the regimen of a military officer, heel just so, toe pointing at that particular angle. Exactly as I was taught. I turned and bent and took small, exquisite leaps. I forced my body into positions it did not want to assume, for dancing required pitting myself against the forces of gravity and air. It was a sort of levitation, a defiance of the laws of nature. Though not--I was certain--the laws of God. No matter what my stern aunts told me, no matter how many times they warned me that I waspirouetting directly over the fires of hell, I knew God wanted me to dance. Why else would I feel so like an angel, as if I'd sprouted strong, white wings lifting me toward heaven?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>AT FOUR-THIRTY, Sophia and I stepped over the threshold into the crystalline air of late afternoon. For a moment I stood looking down the hill to the harbor. It was a view that always affected me because it so starkly symbolized the convergence of man and nature in the orderly march of buildings along the various wharves and the unbridled tumult of the ocean beyond. At the moment, the sea was calm, but I knew that the merest flick of God's finger could transform it into a tempest. Mrs. Brig's house had lost a shutter in the morning's storm, and the linden tree at the foot of the hill was leaning precipitously across the road. The brief sun of late afternoon had begun to melt the snow along the roadside, and I heard the trickle of water close by.Behind me loomed the reassuring bulk of Winslow House, like a mother's skirts protecting and enfolding me. It was where I'd been born and raised, where I'd lived most of my life, save the few years after my parents' death when I boarded with my aunt and uncle. A square-built, wooden house, covered in salt-grayed clapboards, it was handsome in its simple elegance, rising two-and-a-half stories at the end of North Street, on the broad promontory overlooking Plymouth Harbor. Its most notable feature was its double chimneys, which could be seen from Burial Hill, the high ridge where the Pilgrim forefathers lay.Sophia broke my reverie by taking my arm and begging me to hurry, lest we be late. We walked up North Street and beyond, to Town Square, where we found people streaming into the meetinghouse of the First Parish Church. The building, only recently completed, was made of wood and painted gray to resemble stone. Its centerpiece was the great circular stained-glass window that surmounted the doorway. The Gothic style seemed to be all the rage now, yet I wondered at the impulse that prompted this imitation of the cathedrals of Europe. Were we not a new and democratic nation? Should we not invent our own fashions?The pews were already crowded--the only available seats being the second-rate ones to the far right of the pulpit. I grasped Sophia's arm and pulled her smoothly past the round knees of Thomas Batchelder, then settled myself quickly on the wooden bench. I was relieved to note that Mr. Emerson hadnot yet entered the pulpit. I smoothed my skirts and straightened my bonnet, then discreetly signaled Sophia to straighten hers.A ripple of voices at the back of the room drew my attention, and I turned to see Mr. Emerson walk down the aisle. His brown hair glinted in the lamplight, his face serene and composed. He climbed the steps, his arms at his sides. He was a tall man with an unusually long neck and sloping shoulders, a feature of his anatomy that gave him an air of cultivation and congeniality. I noticed that his dark suit betrayed a genteel poverty in the sheen at the elbows and the fraying threads at his cuffs.I sat at an unfortunate angle to the pulpit and there were three tall men seated in front of me. I could not see properly without stretching sideways and craning my neck. Mr. Emerson took some folded papers from the pocket of his jacket and laid them on the lectern. In profile, his nose was beaklike and reminded me of an eagle, an image that somehow matched the sharp blue of his eyes. He turned and his gaze swept over the audience and I imagined that they rested momentarily on me. The sensation unsettled me, but left in its wake a not-unpleasant tingle at the nape of my neck.I refolded my hands--when had they separated and clenched the bench?--and pressed them deep into my lap, then glanced at Sophia, who was again playing with her bonnet strings. I had no time to correct her, for at that moment Mr. Emerson began to speak.As I listened to his words--and not merely his words, but the music of his voice--I felt a strange constriction of my mind and heart. His voice was melodious and oddly calming--its lyric quality made me think of a summer sea. It was as if his tone exerted a physical pressure in my brain, changing its shape and opening it to new ideas.His lecture lasted nearly two hour...</p><h2>The Patchworks of Lucy Boston</h2><p>This lovely book is for everyone who is interested in Lucy Boston&#39;s life and her twenty-two patchworks.

Cast,&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author on&nbsp;<i>Fallen</i></b></p><p><strong>Amazon.com Exclusive: Questions for Lauren Kate</strong> <p> </p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Luce and Daniel's story is very romantic. What inspired you to write a love story between a human and an angel? <br> <b>Lauren Kate:</b> I&#x2019;ve been writing love stories for as long as I&#x2019;ve been writing. To me, the most complicated romances make the most interesting narratives, so I&#x2019;m always looking for new obstacles to throw in my lovers&#x2019; paths. When I was getting my masters degree in fiction, I was studying biblical narratives and came across a line in Genesis (6:1-4), which describes a group of angels who fell in love with mortal women. Putting this reference together with a mention in Isaiah and another in Palsm 82, biblical scholars conclude that these angels were actually cast out of Heaven for their lust. Which means--you could say--that these angels chose love over Heaven. I found this to be an endlessly interesting set up for an incredibly complicated romance. I started thinking about what kind of mortal girl it would take to attract an angel&#x2019;s attention. And what it would be like for her to find herself in this position. What kind of baggage would an angel have? What would her very over-protective parents think? From there, this whole world unfurled in my head with fallen angels, demons, reincarnation, and the war between good and evil all battling for a piece of the action.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> We've been wondering about the "mechanics" of Luce and Daniel's story (for lack of a better word). Does Daniel age? Or does he stay seventeen forever (while Luce grows older)? And with that said, what does he do while Luce is growing up in each of her lives? What was he doing before he met Luce in this life?<br> <b>Kate:</b> What&#x2019;s important about angels is not their bodies but their souls. In their purest forms, they&#x2019;re actually genderless, but for my story to work--for the angels to come down to earth and interact with mortals--they all assume human bodies and attach themselves to human genders. Daniel is eternal and will live on forever, but the body Luce sees him in (gorgeous as it is) is really just a shell for the soul that she loves. There&#x2019;s not the feeling of a ticking clock in the background as there might be with, say, a vampire story. Right now I&#x2019;m writing <em>Passion</em>, the prequel where we&#x2019;ll see Luce and Daniel in a dozen other lifetimes, so I&#x2019;m exploring a lot of these mechanics (a great word for it, by the way) between the angel&#x2019;s bodies and souls.<br><br> The way Daniel occupies himself in between Luces varies from life to life. His soul is least at rest just after she&#x2019;s died, before she&#x2019;s incarnated into another life--when she is &#x201c;in between.&#x201d; During her lives, even when he isn&#x2019;t with her, he is always aware of her age, what she&#x2019;s going through, how she&#x2019;s doing. He has a sort of internal Lucinda clock. Sometimes he meets her as a child, sometimes he tries to stay away from her as long as possible, to give her as much of a life outside of him as he can. In the years leading up to the life where they meet at Sword and Cross, Daniel was living on Skid Row in Los Angeles. </p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> <em>Fallen</em> and <em>Torment</em> talk a lot about the history of Heaven and Hell, the different classes of Angels, and the rules of human-angel interaction. Obviously these themes are explored heavily in religious texts, but were there other sources that informed your story? <br> <b>Kate:</b>It&#x2019;s interesting because there is actually very little in the Bible about angels--a few mentions in the Old Testament, a few more in the new. And the mentions that we do have are often vague or contradictory. Most of what we think of when we think of angels today comes from secular or cultural contexts. Seventy-five percent of it might have come from Milton alone. I worked with a biblical scholar at UC Davis who pointed me toward some apocryphal texts (books written during the same as the bible, but which were not included in the book when the canon was closed). Books like Enoch 1-3 and the Dead Sea Scrolls are chock full of angel references. I also read a trilogy on Satan and a book called the <em>A History of Heaven</em> both by Jeffrey Burton Russell, as well as a great book by Harold Bloom called <em>Omens of the Millennium</em>.<br><br> I got so engrossed in all of the research I did for <em>Fallen</em> that I had a hard time knowing when to stop reading and when to start writing. I had to realize that it was okay for me to pick and choose things from various accounts, to look past contradictions, and to come up with my own angel mythology. That&#x2019;s what Milton did, after all!</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> What is Cam's deal? We're not convinced that he's totally evil--in <em>Fallen</em>, he seemed to be trying to protect Luce by keeping her away from Daniel, and in <em>Torment</em> he and Daniel reach a mysterious truce, again to protect Luce. Will we be seeing more of him in book 3?<br> <b>Kate:</b>Speaking of Milton, isn&#x2019;t it fascinating that Satan is the most interesting character in <em>Paradise Lost</em>? From the start of this series, I have wanted to test the boundaries between what is &#x201c;good&#x201d; and what is &#x201c;evil.&#x201d; How and when do those terms get applied? Are they black and white or is there some flexibility along the spectrum? Obviously it&#x2019;s much more interesting if Heaven and Hell/good and evil work as binaries: opposites that orbit each other and are pulled toward each other with a mutual gravitation. We see that at the end of <em>Fallen</em> and in <em>Torment</em> with Daniel and Cam&#x2019;s truce. The idea that good and evil rely on each other is as old as the oldest dualistic religion, Zoroastrianism (on whose shoulders both Judaism and Christianity stood). <br><br> So yes, there is more to Cam than pure evil! (Especially since his character--the charming side of his character anyway--was based loosely on my husband.) We&#x2019;ll see a lot of him in <em>Passion</em> and will even begin to understand how he got where he is today. </p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Can you tell us a little bit about book 3? Will we find out more about Luce and Daniel's past lives?<br> <b>Kate:</b><em>Passion</em> is going to be the craziest, coolest book I&#x2019;ve ever written! I&#x2019;m halfway through the first draft right now and it is so rewarding to finally get to delve into Luce and Daniel&#x2019;s past lives together. The history these two share is the stuff of epics, and I am learning so many new things about them as I write. For any reader out there feeling tortured by the teasing hints of so many thrilling past lives: <em>Passion</em> is your book!

Beneath all the policy statements and bluster of politicians is a real world of lies, pain, and big money. <br> <i>Down by the River</i> is the true narrative of how a murder led one American family into this world and how it all but destroyed them. It is the story of how one Mexican drug leader outfought and outthought the U.S. government, of how major financial institutions were fattened on the drug industry, and how the governments of the U.S. and Mexico buried everything that happened. All this happens down by the river, where the public fictions finally end and the facts read like fiction. This is a remarkable American story about drugs, money, murder, and family.</p><p>Journalist <b>Charles Bowden</b> has written eleven previous nonfiction books, including <i>Blood Orchid, Trust Me, Desierto, The Sonoran Desert, Frog Mountain Blues,</i> and <i>Killing the Hidden Waters.</i> Winner of the 1996 Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction, he lives in Tucson, Arizona.<i>another country</i><p>We are in the safe house. The sun bakes at ninety and the humidity keeps stride with the sun. Texas wobbles under the blows of summer, the storms threaten, the whiff of tornadoes gives a tang to the changing skies. The street is tree-clogged, narrow, and lined with stretch versions of ranch-style houses. Plano, hugging the north flank of Dallas, is one of the richest suburbs in the United States. This section of that sanctuary houses managers, the lower end of the Plano pecking order.

She was born in Mexico and raised in the United States and most of her life has revolved around the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA. This is not her home, she is just helping out. This could never be her home. Everything about the house is wrong. It reeks of a failed marriage, of depression. And of Anglos. This last failing is never mentioned, it is too obvious for mention.

And she prides herself on being practical, on not succumbing to the fatal temptations of the imagination, and this house is not practical nor is this place. Nor is this thing about the death.</p><p>"They have to let Bruno go, leave him in peace," she offers.</p><p>"But that's hard when he's your own brother," I reply. I don't mention the glass of water and the candle.</p><p>She nods, but still she knows.</p><p>She has been busy telling me everything, about the details of the ruin, the little discrete acts, the betrayals, the hopes dashed. And the hopes once again renewed, just as the hopeless kitchen counter is being renewed as it emerges from months of neglect and begins to shine and smell fresh once again. She is preparing the playing field for her chicken tacos. It has not been easy. The cilantro, for example, sold in Plano is not really cilantro. Here, smell it. See? It is off, like something dead, something faint and lacking soul.</p><p>"Phillip," she announces, and she always calls him Phillip even though every one else calls him Phil, "has to stop this stuff about drugs. It is all he wants to talk about. I go to Mexico and I see hotels and nice businesses and at the trade conferences, no one talks about drugs. And I don't see drugs. He has to stop this."</p><p>"But that is not easy," I reply. "It is everywhere if you look, if you know how to look. It is too big to ignore."</p><p>And then I trail off because I understand her point. It is a healthy point.</p><p>I can't even produce a metaphor for the drug world anymore. I don't even like the phrase the drug world since the phrase implies that it is a separate world. And drugs are as basic and American as, say, Citibank. Mexico's three leading official sources of foreign exchange are oil, tourism, and the money sent home by Mexicans in the United States. Drugs bring Mexico more money than these three sources combined. The United States and Mexico share a common border more than 1,800 miles long. Its official, licit, World Bank-type economy is piddling -- 4.5 percent that of the United States. Both nations, along with Canada, are officially partners in a common market under the umbrella of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Mexico and the United States are partners in an unofficial economy called the drug business.</p><p>The number for the money in the Mexican drug business, around $30 billion annually, came from the Mexican attorney general's office in the mid-1990s, and is smaller than the current take. The number is roughly the same as that quietly issued from time to time by the agencies of the United States government.</p><p>When the drug industry does get mentioned, it gets dismissed by Mexicans blaming the United States for creating the drug market because of its vile habits and the United States blaming Mexico for permitting the drug industry because of its corrupt practices. I disagree with both positions. Drugs are a business, one of the largest on the surface of the earth, and this business exists for two reasons: the products are so very, very good and the profits are so very, very high. Nothing that creates hundreds of billions of dollars of income annually and is desired by millions of people will be stopped by any nation on this earth. A Mexican study by the nation's internal security agency, CISEN (Centro de Investigaci�n y Seguridad Nacional), that has been leaked to the press speculates that if the drug business vanished, the U.S. economy would shrink 19 to 22 percent, the Mexican 63 percent. I stare at these numbers and have no idea if they are sound or accurate. No one can really grapple with the numbers because illegal enterprises can be glimpsed but not measured. In 1995, one Mexican drug-trafficking expert guessed that half the hotel room revenues in his country were frauds, meaning empty rooms counted as sold in order to launder drug money.</p><p>A part of me sympathizes with the woman cleaning the kitchen that is not hers, that is a relic of her lover's failed marriage. I can taste the desire to move on, to leave all the arrests, tortures, corrupt politicians and cops on both sides of the line, to abandon talk of deals and busts. To smell the roses and let the cocaine go to hell or the customers. Outside in the yard, a small dog lazes in the sun, a mongrel from El Paso. The dog is called Cokie, short for Cocaine. And here, the dog's world has been reduced to the decent order of bones, water, a food dish, and two rubber balls for play. The trick is to pretend Mexico does not exist. Or if it does exist, that it is very much like the United States, just with a different cuisine and language. For decades the man of this house kept Mexico at bay. And then, it came visiting in a form that trade agreements and folkloric dances tend to ignore.</p><p>The visit was violent. In Ju�rez, the Mexican city just across the Rio Grande from El Paso, the world has been reduced to this: between 1993 and 2001, at least 2,800 people were either murdered or raped or kidnapped or simply vanished. In Mexico City, the attorney general's office has placed the mug shots of 1,400 federales on a Web site to better enable citizens to identify them when they rob or torture them or, perhaps, kill someone. A Mexico City suburb has followed suit with its police force so that, the mayor explains, the local citizens can protect themselves from the community's eight hundred cops. The mayor already had fired half of the force for corruption. Recently, one Mexican politician called for reinstating capital punishment in Mexico -- solely for police offenders.</p><p>The house is cluttered with DEA bric-a-brac -- plaques, citations, photographs, the litter from a career. The woman wants such things gone, consigned to the past. She wants the breath of a fresh, new life. There is a logic to this since in the end this work with DEA has brought ruin. Yet, it is hard to let it go. It is hard to pretend it never happened. Others can do this, but for those who were involved in the blood rituals such an act requires personal mutilation. I understand this dread of burying the past at the very same instant I share her desire to erase it. Or better yet, to have never known it at all.</p><p>There are things -- the gulag of slave labor camps in the former Soviet Union, the burning bodies of the Holocaust in Europe, the clanking chains of human bondage in the United States -- that intelligent and honest people know occurred and yet grow weary of contemplating. The drug business is not like such things. Beyond some songs, a few action-packed movies, the drug business is never really acknowledged. Drugs may be the major American story of our era, the thing that did more to alter behavior and law, that redistributed income to the poor far more dramatically than any tinkering with tax codes, that jailed more people and killed more people than any U.S. foreign policy initiative since the Vietnam War. But this vital force, this full-tilt-boogie economic activity, is absent from our daily consciousness and only surfaces when discussed as a problem. And this problem is always placed on the other side of town or the other side of a line or the other side of the river.</p><p>Imagine over a quarter of a trillion dollars in a decade, imagine thousands of murders in a decade. Then imagine such things never existed. That is the drug business in one impoverished nation, Mexico. On the U.S. side of the line, all the numbers and consequences are larger.</p><p>The woman is right. Clear the house of this clutter, sell it, move on.</p><p>But there are these things, strands I think, yes, strands weaving together to form a tapestry. In this instance, the tapestry has these little loose ends that are visible, but the weave and tapestry themselves are not. One tiny strand involves Matamoros, the Mexican town facing Brownsville on the Rio Grande. A dozen or so men armed with automatic weapons took over the three-story state police station there one afternoon this season. They carried AK-47s, wore bulletproof vests and masks, and at first the state police thought it was nothing, simply some prank being played by the federal police. The men seized a Mexican soldier being held in a kidnapping case. When they finally left they showered the police station with bullets. In 1984, a similar group of men took over a Matamoros hospital where a business rival was being treated. They left five dead. Then there was a prison riot in 1991 when a drug group took over and burned the place to the ground. Or the time when Juan Garc�a Abrego, the business leader of Matamoros, caused some headlines by kidnapping an Amer...</p></p><h2>The Children of China: An Artist&#39;s Journey</h2><p>Before coming to Canada, while he was still an art teacher in Beijing, Song Nan Zhang traveled from Inner Mongolia east, south, and north to find and paint unusual scenes of Chinese family life.<br><br>Here are the children who grow up in the saddle with their nomadic parents or become as agile as the mountain goats they tend.

Her hopes for the Maddens may be high, but her station among them is low and remote. It soon becomes clear that Stella falls short of even the meager specifications her new role requires, most visibly in the area of "aptitude for the country life." But what drove her to leave her home, job, and life in London in the first place? Why has she severed all ties with her parents? Why is she so reluctant to discuss her past? And who, exactly, is Edward?</p><p><i>The Country Life</i> is a rich and subtle novel about embarrassment, awkwardness, and being alone; about families, or the lack of them; and about love in some peculiar guises. Rachel Cusk's widely praised novel is a captivating tale of one young woman's adventures in self-discovery.</p></p><p>In Rachel Cusk's <i>The Country Life</i>, city mouse Stella abruptly abandons her London career and man for a job in Sussex. Her mission: to care for and transport young Martin, the disabled son of country mice Piers and Pamela Madden, owners of Franchise Farm. Alas, all is not ambrosia in Arcadia. For a start, the Maddens are, well, maddening. The paterfamilias sports "an expression of bright vacancy on his rosy face" whereas his wife evinces a more dramatic sort of derangement: "Pamela, I realized, spoke a language of energetic emergency, in which problems were approached as violently as they were escaped from." To make matters worse, not only does our heroine lack any background in her new field--she doesn't even know how to drive. Long before she's forced behind the wheel, however, Stella is out of her element. Nature, even the very air, seems against her. In one devastating tour de force, she falls asleep in the sun and is hideously burnt (but only on one side of her body!) and then suffers an indoor avian attack. <p> Fans of Stella Gibbons's <i>Cold Comfort Farm</i> will recognize more than a few nods to her classic in Rachel Cusk's hilarious and caustic third novel. For a start, the locals are unfailingly lugubrious, and every dog seems to have it in for our girl from the city. As for her young charge, Martin is either an emotional monster or a savior--though we readers might well opt for the former. <i>The Country Life</i> again and again displays Cusk's eye and ear for surreal comedy and social unpleasantry. Suffice it to say that your idea of a pleasant sojourn--or even a brief walk--in the country will never be the same. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"A sophisticated confection.... Delightful." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> "A brilliant oxymoron--a serious farce so subtle that its command of the reader must be called insidious.... Bright, candid, and modestly humorous, Stella Benson lures us into complicity....Cusk's ability to keep us interested in innumerable human collisions is uncanny. We may finally learn Stella's secrets, but she remains as fascinatingly indecipherable as anyone we know." --<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p> "An oddly ingratiating social comedy....Smart, literate, offbeat, confiding....A pleasure." --<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p> "Enchanting...a funny, modern <i>Jane Eyre</i> combined with an Anne Tyler-esque tale about escaping from the pressures of an unhappy urban life." --<i>Newsday</i></p><p> "Smart, charming, and often outright hilarious." --<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Lifesaving Church, The: Faith Communities and Suicide Prevention</h2><p><i><br></i><b><i>Featured in </i>Publishers Weekly,<i> 8/8/18</i></b><br><i><br></i><i>"There's so much silence around suicide in the church that it is quite literally killing us." --Rachael Keefe</i><br><br><b>Would you know how to respond if the person sitting next to you in your pew was contemplating suicide?</b> Every year, millions of people engage in suicidal activity, including those in our faith communities. Yet the Church remains largely silent around the topics of mental health, depression, and suicide prevention. How can you and your faith community be prepared to recognize and respond to those struggling for their very lives in your church?<br><br>In <i>The Lifesaving Church</i>, pastor Rachael Keefe shatters the taboo of suicide by sharing her own painful story of life-long depression and suicidality--and how her various faith communities responded, for better and for worse. Opening a window into her suicidal behaviors as a young person, Keefe helps us recognize the signs and struggles of those who suffer silently. Reminding us of the Church's call to be the Body of Christ for each other, Keefe empowers us to recognize the hurting in our communities and recover the lifesaving message of the Gospel-- forgiveness, acceptance and love--that helped her to heal. <br><br>With chapters on how to educate your church in suicide prevention, group study reflections around the common questions surrounding suicide, and specific resources, scriptures, and prayers for clergy, suicide loss survivors, and those struggling with suicidality, <i>The Lifesaving Church</i> is critical reading for faith communities seeking abundant life for all of its members.</p><p><b>Rachael A. Keefe</b> is the pastor of Living Table United Church of Christ (UCC) in the Twin Cities and a former clinical chaplain. Since being ordained by the UCC in 1992, Rachael has served in many different ministry settings both traditional and decidedly nontraditional, in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Minnesota. She has a Master of Divinity degree from Princeton Theological School, another Masters degree (ThM) from Princeton, in Christian Education and Counseling, and a doctoral degree (DMin) from Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School. Rachael is a pastor, an author, a painter, and a poet. On sunny afternoons you might see her with her easel at a local park or river walkway.<i>The Lifesaving Church</i> is an unflinchingly faith-filled resource for Christians helping people who are facing mental illness and considering suicide.... What the book does best is equip ministers and congregants to care for others early and for the long haul saving lives, yes, but also transforming their communities into safe places that ensure the thriving of each and every person. That, it claims, is the true gift that God designed for the church to give to the world: healthy life together. And despite the complexity of modern life, Keefe has unswerving faith that the church can live up to its call." --<i>Foreword Reviews, </i>May/June 2018<br><br>One compelling lesson evident in Rachael Keefe's unsettling memoir is that the scars of childhood bullying, abuse, and neglect linger for a lifetime. Another is that even one hospitable minister, teacher, counselor, or especially in her case an ordinary faith community can make all the difference in rescuing and revitalizing that wounded child and child-within. In an era of relentless headlines of anxiety and despair, <i>The Lifesaving Church</i> arrives on the scene as a welcome-and welcoming-witness to perseverance and hope. --Robert C. Dykstra, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br><i>The Lifesaving Church</i> is a powerful book about suicide prevention that every church leader needs to read. Through compelling and courageous storytelling, followed by practical steps that you can do today, this book is a guide that will help churches fulfill their mission to save lives." --Sarah Griffith Lund, author of <i>Blessed Are the Crazy</i></p><h2>Chester and Gus</h2><p><p>Critically acclaimed author Cammie McGovern presents a heartwarming and humorous middle grade novel about the remarkable bond that forms between an aspiring service dog and an autistic boy in need of a friend. &#x201c;<strong>Joyful, inspiring, and completely winning, <em>Chester and Gus</em> is unforgettable</strong>,&#x201d; proclaimed Katherine Applegate, #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the Newbery Medal winner <em>The One and Only Ivan.</em></p><p>Chester has always wanted to become a service dog.

Her honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship, a PEN/Voelcker Award, and a Theodore Roethke Memorial Poetry Prize. She is a distinguished professor in the MFA Program in Creative Writing &amp; Literary Translation, Queens College, City University of New York, and lives in Queens.A kind of poet's journal or miscellany, mixing verse with prose, considered ideas with spontaneous exclamations, notes to friends and even e-mails, Hahn's seventh book adapts the traditional Japanese prose poetry genre <i>zuihitsu</i> to modern American aims. The notebook form allows room for scenes in Brooklyn and on Cape Cod; the poet's feelings about her preteen daughter and her former husband; her thoughts on academia and on Asian-Americanness; her experience of her own body, in youth, in sex and in middle age; and her reactions to 9/11. Honesty has long stood among Hahn's strengths: "I want hands on my face the way no husband or woman has ever held me." Childhood recollections are also movingly evoked: "I need not write about those snow forts where I lay on my back looking up at the ceiling turning into twilight, my mother calling from the trite threshold." Hahn's self-consciousness about this cross-cultural form&#x2014;a recurring theme&#x2014;can become self-indulgent, and the development comes not from a change in Hahn, but from the terrorist attack on her city. No revelation emerges at notebook's end.

Now the legendary spymaster has emerged from the shadows to reveal his remarkable life of secrets, lies, and betrayals as head of the world's most formidable and effective foreign service ever. Wolf was undoubtedly the greatest spymaster of our century. A shadowy Cold War legend who kept his own past locked up as tightly as the state secrets with which he was entrusted, Wolf finally broke his silence in 1997. <i>Man Without a Face</i> is the result. It details all of Wolf's major successes and failures and illuminates the reality of espionage operations as few nonfiction works before it. Wolf tells the real story of Gunter Guillaume, the East German spy who brought down Willy Brandt. He reveals the truth behind East Germany's involvment with terrorism. He takes us inside the bowels of the Stasi headquarters and inside the minds of Eastern Bloc leaders. With its high-speed chases, hidden cameras, phony brothels, secret codes, false identities, and triple agents, <i>Man Without a Face</i> reads like a classic spy thriller&#x2014;except this time the action is real.</p><p>Imagine if Heinrich Himmler or Lavrenti Beria had written an autobiography! Well, a secret police chief of even greater prowess (and even greater secrecy) has done just that. For 34 years--through almost the whole of the Cold War--Markus Wolf was the head of East Germany's foreign intelligence service. As such, he gathered and disseminated to his Soviet sponsors many of the deepest top secrets of the whole era. A good example of the mirrors-within-mirrors nature of Wolf's world is his description of his service's interactions with celebrated terrorist Carlos the Jackal. Wolf relates that whenever Carlos came to East Berlin, the spymaster's main concern was "getting him out of the country as soon as possible." But this proved difficult because well, Carlos was a <i>terrorist</i> not above turning on his hosts. Indeed, Wolf reveals that while Carlos was a guest of his government, he made threats against East Germany's Paris embassy and that the reaction was not to expel him, but to beef up embassy security. Similarly, Wolf tells how the 1986 La Belle disco bombing in West Berlin, which killed two U.S. soldiers and resulted in a U.S. reprisal air strike against Libya, involved East Germany's knowing admission through border control of Libyan diplomats with explosives in their luggage. Here, Wolf questions the notion that such terrorists were worth coddling for their usefulness in any all-out war against the West. You have to wonder if he also did so in his old job.nating and revealing autobiography, Markus Wolf, East Germany&#39;s chief foreign intelligence officer and foremost spymaster of the Eastern Bloc, tells his own dramatic story, a true thriller and a stunning examination of loyalty, betrayal, and the long shadow of history. of photos.</p><h2>The Blessing</h2><p><i>The Blessing </i>is one of Nancy Mitford&#x2019;s most personal books, a wickedly funny story that asks whether love can survive the clash of cultures.<br><br>When Grace Allingham, a na�ve young Englishwoman, goes to live in France with her dashingly aristocratic husband Charles-Edouard, she finds herself overwhelmed by the bewilderingly foreign cuisine and the shockingly decadent manners and mores of the French. But it is the discovery of her husband&#x2019;s French notion of marriage&#x2014;which includes a permanent mistress and a string of casual affairs&#x2014;that sends Grace packing back to London with their &#x201c;blessing,&#x201d; young Sigismond, in tow. While others urge the couple to reconcile, little Sigi&#x2014;convinced that it will improve his chances of being spoiled&#x2014;applies all his juvenile cunning to keeping his parents apart. Drawing on her own years in Paris and her long affair with a Frenchman, Mitford elevates cultural and romantic misunderstandings to the heights of comedy.</p><p><b>Nancy Mitford</b>, daughter of Lord and Lady Redesdale and the eldest of the six legendary Mitford sisters, was born in 1904 and educated at home on the family estate in Oxfordshire. She made her debut in London and soon became one of the bright young things of the 1920s, a close friend of Henry Green, Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman, and their circle. A beauty and a wit, she began writing for magazines and writing novels while she was still in her twenties. In all, she wrote eight novels as well as biographies of Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire, Louis XIV, and Frederick the Great. She died in 1973.

Somebody was stamping about, moving furniture, throwing windows up and down, and clearing his throat exaggeratedly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Ahem! Ahem!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;How long has he been here, Nanny?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Nearly an hour I should think. He played the piano, very fast and loud, for a while, which seemed to keep him quiet. He&#x2019;s only started this shindy since John went and told him you were in and would be down presently.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You go, darling, and tell him he must wait while I change out of these trousers,&#x2019; said Grace, who was vigorously cleaning her neck with cotton wool. &#x2018;Oh, the dirt. What I need is a bath.&#x2019;<br> The drawing-room door was now flung open.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Do I see you or not?&#x2019; The voice was certainly foreign.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;All right &#x2013; very well. I&#x2019;ll come down now, this minute.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> She looked at Nanny, laughing, and said, &#x2018;He might go through the floor, like Rumpelstiltskin.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Nanny said, &#x2018;Put on a dress dear, you can&#x2019;t go down like that.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Shall I come upstairs?&#x2019; said the voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;No, don&#x2019;t, here I am,&#x2019; and Grace ran down, still in her A.R.P.trousers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Frenchman, tall, dark and elegant, in French Air Force uniform, was on the drawing-room landing, both hands on the banister rail. He seemed about to uproot the delicate woodwork. When he saw Grace he said &#x2018;Ah!&#x2019; as though her appearance caused him gratified surprise, then, &#x2018;Is this a uniform? It&#x2019;s not bad. Did you receive my note?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Only now,&#x2019; said Grace. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve been at the A.R.P. all day.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> They went into the drawing-room. &#x2018;Your writing is very difficult. I was still puzzling over it when I heard all that noise &#x2013; it was like the French Revolution. You must be a very impatient man.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;No. But I don&#x2019;t like to be kept waiting, though this room has more compensations than most, I confess.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I wouldn&#x2019;t have kept you waiting if I&#x2019;d known a little sooner &#x2013; why didn&#x2019;t you . . .&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> He was no longer listening, he had turned to the pictures on the walls.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I do love this Olivier,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;You must give it to me.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Except that it belongs to Papa.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Ah yes, I suppose it does. Sir Conrad. He is very well known in the Middle East &#x2013; I needn&#x2019;t tell you, however. The Allingham Commission, ah! cunning Sir Conrad. He owes something to my country, after that.&#x2019; He turned from the picture to Grace looking at her rather as if she were a picture, and said, &#x2018;Natoire, or Rosalba. You could be by either.&nbsp; Well, we shall see, and time will show.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Papa loves France.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure he does. The Englishmen who love France are always the worst.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;The worst?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Each man kills the thing he loves, you know. Never mind.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve come from Cairo?&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;I thought I read Cairo in your letter and something about Hughie? You saw him?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;The fianc� I saw.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;And you&#x2019;ve come to give me news of him?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Good news &#x2013; that is to say no news. Why is this picture labeled Drouais?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I suppose it is by Drouais,&#x2019; said Grace with perfect indifference.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brought up among beautiful things, she took but small account of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Indeed? What makes you think so?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Are you an art dealer?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;An art deal-ee.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;But you said you had news. Naturally I supposed it was the reason for your visit, to tell this news.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Have you any milk chocolate?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;No, I&#x2019;m sure we haven&#x2019;t.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Never mind.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Would you like a cocktail &#x2013; or a glass of sherry?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Sherry, with delight.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Did you enjoy Cairo? Hughie says it&#x2019;s great fun.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;The museum is wonderful &#x2013; but of course no pictures, while the millionaires, poor dears, have wonderful pictures, for which they&#x2019;ve paid wonderful prices (from those ateliers where Renoirs and Van Goghs are painted on purpose for millionaires), but which hardly satisfy one&#x2019;s cravings. Even their Corots are not always by Trouillebert. You see exactly how it is. So this afternoon I went to the National Gallery &#x2013; shut. That is war. Now you will understand what an oasis I have found in Sir Conrad&#x2019;s drawing-room, though I must have a word with him some time about this Drouais, so called.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I&#x2019;m afraid you won&#x2019;t see many pictures in London now,&#x2019; said Grace. &#x2018;Papa has sent all his best ones to the country, and most people have shut up their houses, you know.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Never mind. I love London, even without pictures, and English women I love.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Do you? Don&#x2019;t we seem terribly dowdy?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Of course. That&#x2019;s what make you so amusing and mysterious. What can you possibly do, all day?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Do?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Yes. How do you fill those endless eons of time when Frenchwomen are having their hair washed, trying on hats, visiting the collections, discussing with the <i>ling�re </i>&#x2013; what is <i>ling�re </i>in English?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Underclothes-maker.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Hours they spend with the underclothes-maker. What a funny word &#x2013; are you sure? Anyhow, Frenchwomen always give one to understand that arranging themselves is full-time work. Now you English, like flowers in a basket, are not arranged, which is quite all right when the flowers are spring flowers.&#x2019; He gave her another long, approving look. &#x2018;But how do you fill in the time? That is the great puzzle.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x2019; she said, laughing, &#x2018;that we fill it in (not now, of course, but before the war) buying clothes and hats and having our hair washed. Perhaps the results were not quite the same, but I assure you that great efforts were made.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Please don&#x2019;t tell me. Do leave me in the dark, it makes you so much more interesting. Do let me go on believing that the hours drift by in a dream, that those blind blue eyes which see nothing, not even your father&#x2019;s pictures, are turned inward upon some Anglo-Saxon fairyland of your own. Am I not right?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> He was quite right, though perhaps she hardly knew it herself.</p><h2>Perseus and the Monstrous Medusa (12) (Heroes in Training)</h2><p>Perseus and the Olympians face off against the Monstrous Medusa in this Heroes in Training adventure.</p><p>Joan Holub has authored and/or illustrated over 140 children&#x2019;s books, including the Goddess Girls series, the Heroes in Training series, the <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling picture book&nbsp;<i>Mighty Dads</i>&nbsp;(illustrated by James Dean), and&nbsp;<i>Little Red Writing</i>&nbsp;(illustrated by Melissa Sweet).

Apollo had been singing about the Olympians&#x2019; current quest for the last two miles. &#x201c;Will you please stop singing that song?&#x201d; Zeus asked him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, snakes don&#x2019;t have long hair. Or feet,&#x201d; Hera scoffed. She and Zeus&#x2019;s two other sisters, Demeter and Hestia, were walking right behind Zeus, Apollo, and gray-eyed Athena. Zeus&#x2019;s brothers, Hades and Poseidon, trooped side by side a little ways back of them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, these snakes are probably Creatures of Chaos, so they might have feet,&#x201d; said Apollo. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ares, who came next with the blond and beautiful Aphrodite, waved his spear. &#x201c;I hope they&#x2019;re giant, hairy jungle snakes! That would be a great fight!&#x201d; The god of war&#x2019;s red eyes shone at the thought.<br> <br>Zeus shuddered. In his humble opinion, there&#x2019;d been far too much fighting during all their other quests. As leader of the Olympians, he felt it was his duty to help them avoid fights whenever possible. Unfortunately they didn&#x2019;t always have that choice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just hope they&#x2019;re not poisonous snakes,&#x201d; called out Artemis, who was Apollo&#x2019;s twin sister. With a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows slung across her back, she was marching alongside her brother.<br> <br>&#x201c;I bet I could make a mechanical snake,&#x201d; mused Hephaestus as he struggled to keep pace with the others. He&#x2019;d crafted the cool silver cane that helped him walk. It was carved with wicked-looking skulls. He was a genius when it came to crafting mechanical metal machinery, tools, and creatures.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we please stop talking about snakes?&#x201d; Zeus asked the group. &#x201c;I know Pythia told us to find hairy ones. But she&#x2019;s never exactly right when she sends us on a quest. For all we know, we could be looking for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fairy cakes instead of hairy snakes. Or something like that, anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ares frowned. &#x201c;Fairy cakes? That wouldn&#x2019;t be much of a fight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m tired of fighting,&#x201d; said Hestia, the goddess of the hearth. &#x201c;I wish these quests were over and we could all go home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re Olympians!&#x201d; cried Poseidon, whose eyes were as turquoise as the sea. &#x201c;We have no home&#x2014;not until we defeat King Cronus and the other Titans.&#x201d; Titans were giants as tall as oak trees.<br> <br>&#x201c;And the Cronies,&#x201d; Ares added. Cronies were the army of half-giants who obeyed King Cronus. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to defeat them, too!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was from Pythia, the Oracle at Delphi&#x2014;who could see the future but not always clearly&#x2014;that the Olympians had learned their destiny. Which was to save Greece from evil Cronus and the cruel Titans. Then the Olympians would rule in King Cronus&#x2019;s place. And it was also from Pythia that Zeus had found out he was destined to become the ruler of everyone. The number one guy in charge.<br> <br>At the moment, though, Zeus would gladly have let someone else take charge. And not just because he didn&#x2019;t want another fight on his hands. No. He could handle another fight if he had to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as long as it didn&#x2019;t involve snakes. Especially hairy, scary, and possibly poisonous ones. He had faced enemies as tall as mountains, but snakes? He shuddered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me just say that when we are finally done with all our quests and have defeated our enemies, I plan to ban snakes!&#x201d; Zeus declared.<br> <br>Aphrodite&#x2019;s blue eyes went round. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen one. What do they look like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What, were you born yesterday?&#x201d; Hera asked. Then she grinned. &#x201c;Oh, right! You were.&#x201d;<br> <br>She wasn&#x2019;t just teasing. It was true. Pretty Aphrodite had risen from the ocean the day before on a mound of bubbles. There were still a lot of things she didn&#x2019;t know about the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Snakes are like worms, only way bigger,&#x201d; explained Hades. He was the ruler of the Underworld, a gloomy, smelly place belowground. &#x201c;They have fangs that can bite you and sometimes poison you, and they slither along silently so you don&#x2019;t know they&#x2019;re coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I see,&#x201d; said Aphrodite, sounding blissfully unconcerned. Then she asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a worm?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we please talk about something else?&#x201d; Zeus pleaded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ooh, Boltbrain is afraid of snakes,&#x201d; Hera teased in a singsong voice.<br> <br>Usually Zeus could put up with her teasing, but not about this. &#x201c;Just forget it!&#x201d; He stomped ahead of the group and kept on marching. The path they were on wound along the top of a ridge. Down below, he could see ocean waves lapping against the sandy shore.<br> <br>Athena ran up to him. &#x201c;Listen, I know you don&#x2019;t want to talk about snakes right now, but I need to tell you something.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus sighed. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s about the aegis,&#x201d; she said. She opened the front of her cloak to reveal the shiny, gold shield she wore over her chest. Decorated with gold studs, the aegis was a magical object. Hera had found it in a Titan&#x2019;s house, and Pythia said it belonged to both Zeus and Athena.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know that image that appears on the aegis sometimes? The one that turned the spiders into stone?&#x201d; Athena asked.<br> <br>Zeus nodded. Sometimes the face of a terrifying woman with snakes on her head appeared on the shield. That image had recently scared off some spiders that had wanted to munch the Olympians for dinner.<br> <br>Zeus stopped walking as something dawned on him. &#x201c;Hey! The woman on that shield! You think she could be real? You think her snakes are the ones Pythia meant us to find?&#x201d; he asked Athena. The rest of the Olympians had caught up to Athena and him and were all listening now.<br> <br>Hephaestus leaned on his silver cane. &#x201c;A real woman with live snake hair?&#x201d; he snorted. &#x201c;Who ever heard of that? It&#x2019;s crazy!&#x201d;</p><h2>The Revealer: The scientific philosophy of theology</h2><p>Traditionally, science and religion have kept their distance. <p></p><p> But one pioneering researcher dared to apply scientific method to many religious claims. He dared to ask questions that many people condemn you just for asking.</p><p> The answers may surprise you. This book has stirred up controversy, but progress comes, like it or not. </p><p> If you are ready for a scientific look at religion, read this book. </p><p> <i>The Revealer </i> is about the achievements of Jos� Silva whose investigative mind became attracted to the study of the evolution of humanity. </p><p> Silva reviewed human history and found many ups and downs. He noted that at a time when humanity was progressing very well, a war would break out, setting humanity back. </p><p> In technology, humanity has been progressing steadily, but even while doing so, it was losing humaneness, Silva says. He means that human intelligence was gaining in the objective, physical, dimension, but at the same time, was losing in the subjective, spiritual, dimension. </p><p> The mind and soul reside in a subjective, spiritual, dimension, Silva says, while the brain and body reside in the objective, physical, dimension. </p><p> Recent research reveals that: </p><p> *The human left brain hemisphere is associated with the physical dimension, and is used for taking action. </p><p> *The human right brain hemisphere is associated with the spiritual dimension, and is intended to be used for thinking, for analyzing information, and for making decisions. </p><p> But most human beings, approximately 90 percent, use the left brain hemisphere for both thinking and acting. </p><p> His research revealed that the ten percent who use the right brain hemisphere for thinking and the left brain hemisphere for acting are healthier, luckier, and more successful than those who use only the left brain hemisphere for both thinking and acting. </p><p> It took Silva 22 years of scientific research to find a way to teach people to use the information stored in the subconscious. </p><p> This actually converted the subconscious into an "inner conscious" level, where we now have access to information previously unavailable to us. In this book, you can see for yourself the similarities of the benefits derived from using the Systems that Jos� Silva developed, compared to the Biblical account of the benefits of using the Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven. </p><p> "What I did," Silva explains, "was to take the writings of each author in the Bible and put those writing to a scientific test, then evaluate the results. </p><p> "So what I have done, right or wrong, is to take information, a little bit at a time, and test it by trying to use it to solve existing problems with it." If the information could not be used to correct problems, then it was useless information and had no value as far as he was concerned. </p><p> He concludes, "The truthful truth is only that which, when applied, solves problems. This applies to all information, regardless of where it comes from and regardless of how new or old it is." </p><p> This book goes into detail about Silva's research and his conclusions. </p><p> It also includes a scientific way to pray, to communicate regularly and reliably with higher intelligence to help you solve problems and improve living conditions on planet earth.</p></p><p>Jos� Silva&#39;s life is more than a great American success story. It has transcended time and space to become one of the world&#39;s all time great success stories. Orphaned at age 4, he never attended school a day in his life as a student; yet the reading and research that he undertook to help his own children, unlocked secrets of the mind and human potential that had remained hidden for thousands of years. Jos� Silva&#39;s 22 years of dogged determination to dig out these secrets has literally changed the world. He actually found the secret of success. He first started working with his own children in 1944, then in the 1950s and 1960s helped his neighbors learn how to actually use the untapped power of their minds to get whatever they wanted. While he never asked them to pay him, he was rewarded greatly with more knowledge on this subject than anyone else on the planet. From 1966 to 1998 his Silva Mind Control Method helped millions of people worldwide, and since 1998 his Silva UltraMind ESP System is leading people into what he called &#34;the beginning of the second phase of human evolution on the planet.&#34; This man with no formal schooling wrote the book on mind development - in fact, he has had more than a dozen books published by major publishers, in two dozen languages. Prior to his passing in 1999 he developed a new course - actually more than a course, he calls it a System: The Silva UltraMind ESP System. In addition to helping people develop and use their own God-given intuition, the UltraMind ESP System includes a new scientifically-based technique to communicate with higher intelligence regularly and reliably to obtain help and guidance in carrying out your mission in life. While Jos� Silva may have moved on to new assignments, his work is still going strong, in live seminars, books, and in convenient home study courses. There are many courses that are &#34;based on&#34; his work, but the only courses still being taught that he authored himself, based on his 22 years of scientific research, are the Silva UltraMind ESP System, and his Holistic Faith Healing System.

She lives in Wilmington, North Carolina.</p>chapter 1 <br> <br>&nbsp; <br> <br> <i>Check-Splitting: Who Had the Gorgonzola Crumbles, and Should We Really Care?</i> <br>My friend Gray and I have often chuckled at the memory of how our mothers and grandmothers would agonize over splitting the check following the conclusion of a ladies&#x2019; lunch on the town. Finally, at some point, one of the ladies would say to one member of the group, &#x201c;Since you drove, we&#x2019;ll pay the tip.&#x201d; <br>Gray and I have been friends for three decades, ever since we met on the job at a daily newspaper where she was a photographer and I wrote feature stories about mules being born and the like. It&#x2019;s amazing that we were able to get jobs even though we were clearly very young children thirty years ago. Practically embryos. Anywho, it goes without saying that we have eaten many, many meals together in all kinds of restaurants and with all kinds of people over the years. <br>Because this is such a treasured bond between us, as soon as the check comes, one of us will chuckle and say to the other: &#x201c;Since you drove&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Maybe you have to be there. <br>The point is, we know that dividing the check at the restaurant can bring out all sorts of unintentionally rude behavior. At the heart of this sort of accidental etiquette breach is that it is ever so tacky to ever discuss money in public. It just is. <br>And while offering to pay the tip because gas was purchased by one of the members of the party is, on the face of it, a nice gesture, it only serves to muddy the waters. <br>How far must we carry this? As I write this, gas is about $3.44 a gallon in my hometown. If I take two friends to lunch downtown on our lovely riverfront, I&#x2019;ve used no more than $1.10 in gas to pick them up. <br>This is less than the cost of a glass of sweet tea these days, so really, must we make it an issue? Should I point out that, because I drove, the rest of the lunch party owes me about one-fourth of the Caribbean Fudge Pie that I am, too, ordering even though my ass is spilling over either side of my chair. <br>No. <br>But still, in some quarters, you will hear all sorts of reasons why someone should pay a smaller percentage (or a higher one!) of the check when it arrives. <br>This is something that makes the server crazy. Hasn&#x2019;t she already been sufficiently inconvenienced by your insistence that the check be split six ways and that approximately one and a half of you are going in together to pay for the seventh woman&#x2019;s bill because it&#x2019;s her birthday? <br>Where are my smelling salts? <br> <i>Question: We go out to dinner about once a month on a Saturday night with two couples who live in our cul-de-sac. We really like everything about these couples except for the fact that they drink very expensive wines with dinner and my husband and I are teetotalers. When the bill arrives, you guessed it, they always split it three ways even though we just ordered chicken cutlets and water!</i> <br>Okay, <i>you</i> guessed it: I don&#x2019;t need my smelling salts anymore; I need a very dry Grey Goose martini as big as my head. Ahh. There. Much better. Now, where were we? Oh, yes. You and your lushy fun friends sticking you with the wine bill&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>First of all, let the record show that your couple-friends are assholes. Just because you share a driveway with someone doesn&#x2019;t mean that they should be your dinner companions. And, not to put too fine a point on this, but you and your husband sound like you&#x2019;d be happier with your own kind. I mean, who the hell goes out to eat and orders a chicken cutlet and water on a Sadday night? I mean besides Garrison Keillor. For Christ&#x2019;s sake, it&#x2019;s <i>Saturday night.</i> Live a little&#x2014;get the osso bucco. Look it up. <br>I&#x2019;m sorry. I don&#x2019;t for an instant mean to imply that just because you don&#x2019;t drink, you&#x2019;re no fun. I just want to come right out and say it: You&#x2019;re No Fun. <br>Assuming that you really do want to continue this pitiful dinner charade for your own weird reasons (swapping, perhaps?) I will answer your question. <br>You&#x2019;re going to have to speak up. Yes! Crazy and radical, I know! You&#x2019;re going to actually form the sentence in your empty noggin, feel the words in your mouth, and then hear them hang on the air. <br>Here&#x2019;s what you say: <br>&#x201c;Roscoe and I didn&#x2019;t have wine, so y&#x2019;all can split that and leave us out of it.&#x201d; <br>Man, oh, man, how I&#x2019;d love to be a fly on the wall when that happens. Sorry. I was assuming this was a Denny&#x2019;s, but then I remembered the &#x201c;fine wine&#x201d; thing. <br>Their jaws will drop and they&#x2019;ll be shocked that, after many months of sticking you with a third of the fancy wine you didn&#x2019;t drink, the metaphorical scales have fallen from your eyes. Crappidy-doo-dah. Game over. <br>You see, they&#x2019;ve been wondering what is wrong with you for all this time anyway. Are you so desperate for friends that you have to buy them? Because that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re doing every time you meekly fork over your credit card for your third of the bill. We&#x2019;re done here. <br>Almost&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>Is there anything more agonizing than hearing a humiliating recitation of everything you&#x2019;ve eaten by the number-crunching weirdo in your party? <br>&#x201c;Madge, you had the arugula-beet salad, but you added on the gorgonzola crumbles for a dollar seventy-five, so&nbsp;&#x2026; your share comes to&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>It is just such a terrible end to what could have been a lovely lunch or dinner. To hear your every lamb lollipop recounted (two at $11.95 each&#x2026;) is simply horrifying. <br>The rule is simple: separate checks if appropriate (that means a party of six or fewer) and, for larger groups, a commitment to accepting that the bill should be split evenly. <br>There&#x2019;s often an outlier, of course. There&#x2019;s the pale friend who must have everything &#x201c;gluten-free&#x201d; or she will double over and collapse in a tower of her own shit mid-meal. This is always such a downer for the rest of the table. Maybe you could ask her to sit elsewhere? Like Indiana? <br>While we&#x2019;re still in the restaurant, so to speak, let&#x2019;s take a moment to remind one another that the waiter is there to do a job, not to hear about your &#x201c;gastric bypass,&#x201d; &#x201c;lactose intolerance,&#x201d; &#x201c;gastroesophageal reflux,&#x201d; &#x201c;homoerotica fantasies,&#x201d; and the like. <br>He or she also doesn&#x2019;t need to hear that if he accidentally gives you caffeinated coffee, your heart will fly out of your chest and sit on the table, thumping away, while all you and your lunch companions can do is watch until it finally, mercifully, stops. <br>Here&#x2019;s a tip: They don&#x2019;t care about your coffee preference. They asked you only because you expected it. The truth is, you&#x2019;ll get decaf if it&#x2019;s convenient, and if it&#x2019;s not, well, that&#x2019;s a mighty fine-looking aorta you got there. <br>Remember that it&#x2019;s important to tip generously, especially if you ever plan to return. Servers remember the cheap creep that ran &#x2019;em ragged and left a cool ten-spot for a hundred-dollar meal. You know who you are. For the love of Bobby Flay, tip for good service, tip for lousy service, just tip. Some of y&#x2019;all can be pretty demanding. <br>Example: &#x201c;We need more bread. And when you get back, I&#x2019;m going to think up a few other things we need, but I&#x2019;m only going to list them one at a time so you have to make a bunch of trips.&#x201d; <br>Just remember: These servers can do awful things to your food right before it comes out. Awful things. <br>That&#x2019;s Not a Salad Fork, You Stupid Bitch <br>A lot of people get confused when they&#x2019;re in a nice restaurant and there are, like, a million forks surrounding their plates. <br>There&#x2019;s no reason to fret. Generally speaking, silver is placed in the order of its use, so you pick up the piece on the outside first. See? That wasn&#x2019;t so hard, was it? <br>When you&#x2019;ve finished eating (or, as we say in the South, &#x201c;had a sufficiency&#x201d;), avoid announcing this by saying, loudly, &#x201c;Damn, I&#x2019;m stuffed!&#x201d; or worse, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m chewin&#x2019; high.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s no need to announce the state of your stomach. No one is interested, and the notion that you need to give alerts&#x2014;as though, if you lifted your shirt, a fuel gauge just like your car has would be revealed with a wand wavering between E and F&#x2014;is truly off-putting. Along these lines, never, ever burp and then say &#x201c;Yay! Room for more!&#x201d; <br>That said, when you&#x2019;re finished, really finished, not just talking about how full you are and continuing to shovel it in, place your fork on your plate, prongs down, beside your knife with the blade facing the fork. I am, too, serious. Good table etiquette is all that separates us from Kardashians&#x2014;er, savages. <br>Some other tips&nbsp;&#x2026; Always break bread with your fingers; never cut it with a knife. The bread knife is just for buttering and is also dreadfully unhandy for stabbing intruders; trust me. <br>A word about artichokes: Don&#x2019;t ever order them. Nobody looks good sucking on leaves. Not even a koala bear, and damn sure not you. <br>Know your limits: Don&#x2019;t order lobster, tails-on shrimp, Cornish game hen, and so forth, in a nice restaurant. You&#x2019;re going to look like a doofus no matter how hard you try not to, and it honestly doesn&#x2019;t help when you insist &#x201c;I eat this shit all the time. Really.&#x201d; Ditto ordering something you don&#x2019;t know how to pronounce. <br>Good: &#x201c;French onion soup.&#x201d; <br>Bad: &#x201c;Duck cawn-fit.&#x201d; <br>A word about finger bowls: Okay, don&#x2019;t freak out when you see one for the first time, Gomer. And don&#x2019;t take a bath in it, either. Just dab the tips of your fingers in the bowl, and for the love of God, don&#x2019;t try to make a joke by also dabbing at your underarms and crotch. <br>Okay, maybe the underarms. That&#x2019;s actually pretty funny sometimes. <br>Don&#x2019;t talk with your mouth full. Don&#x2019;t talk with your mouth full. Don&#x2019;t talk with your mouth full. <br>Now.

Return to Mustang Creek, Wyoming, with #1 New York Times bestselling author Linda Lael Miller for more Brides of Bliss County!&nbsp;</b><br><br>Since Hadleigh, Melody and Bex&#x2014;the best of best friends&#x2014;entered into a marriage pact, two of them have found (and married) the men of their hearts. But Bex doesn't think she'll be as fortunate as the others. Her own first love died years ago in a faraway war, and Bex has lost hope for a happy marriage of her own. She concentrates on her business, a successful chain of fitness clubs, instead.&nbsp;<br><br>Then, when single father Tate Calder comes to Mustang Creek with his two sons in tow, who befriend Bex's eight-year-old nephew, she and the handsome, aloof newcomer are constantly thrown together. But is the marriage season over? Or can a man with doubts about love be the right husband for a woman who wants it all?</p><p><b>Linda LaelMiller</b> is a #1&nbsp;<i>New YorkTimes</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>USA TODAY </i>bestselling author of morethan&nbsp;one hundred&nbsp; novels. Long passionate about the Civil War buff, she has studied theera avidly and has&nbsp;made many visits to Gettysburg,&nbsp; where she has witnessedreenactments of the legendary clash between North and South. Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i>Leaves floated down like rain and littered the path with bright color, red and aspen gold. The air had a crisp bite to it, clean and fresh, the scent of autumn. Above, the sky was cloudless, a pure Wyoming blue. Perfect training weather.<br><br>Becca "Bex" Stuart flashed by another runner with a nod. The trail was busy on this Saturday morning. Mustang Creek had put in a series of municipal paths specifically for walking, biking and running, and the money had, in her opinion, been well spent. She sure took advantage of her tax dollars every chance she got.<br><br>Just a light run. That was her goal this fine morning. Luckily, Bex had access, thanks to her business, to the finest athletic equipment available, so she could get an accurate time. The upcoming marathon was the usual 26.2 miles, and her strategy was to gradually work up to that. And then she'd begin tapering down. By next Saturday she should be ready.<br><br>Her friends thought she was insane.<br><br>From experience, because this wasn't her first endurance race, Bex knew they could be right. Mile nineteen was where you just wanted to chuck it all and quit, but if you got past it...you were home free.<br><br>Her phone, clipped to her shorts, beeped.<br><br>A text.<br><br>She could read it as she ran; however, she couldn't answer, not without stopping, and she wasn't going to stop now.<br><br>It was from one of her best friends, Melody, recently married, so now Mrs. Spencer Hogan.<br><br>Meet us at the ranch for lunch? Hadleigh and I want to talk to you.<br><br>It was, according to her high-tech pedometer, a manageable time frame as long as they meant around noon. She was able to type K without breaking stride.<br><br>There was definitely a shower in her future before she sat down with other human beings to eat&#x2014;as a favor to them. Despite the cool temperature, Bex was perspiring, as she should be, or she wasn't trying hard enough.<br><br>"Bex? Bex Stuart?"<br><br>Male voice. Familiar.<br><br>The sound jarred Bex out of her endorphin haze, brought the world around her back into focus.<br><br>She'd just reached the second loop around Pioneer Park, and the place was filled with small, noisy kids celebrating life in general. The male voice belonged to Tate Calder, she saw with dismay, his two young sons among the crowd of children crawling all over the playground equipment.<br><br>Tate looked, as usual, put together and handsome with his clean-cut features, wavy chestnut hair and dark eyes. He wore a leather jacket and nice jeans, while she was arrayed in the scruffiest outfit she owned&#x2014;and, naturally, sweaty, as well.<br><br>Great.<br><br>"Hi," she said. Not exactly brilliant, but polite at least. A little breathless, Bex ran in place, her body on autopilot. <em>Keep that heart rate up.</em><br><br>Not that it was a problem. Just <em>looking</em> at this man seemed to have an aerobic effect on her.<br><br>She'd encountered Tate two or three times before, since he was a friend of Hadleigh's husband, Tripp, both men having flown for the same company as charter pilots back in the day, before Tripp decided it was time to sell the firm and come home to Mustang Creek.<br><br>Tate's dark eyes were amused, missing nothing. "How've you been?"<br><br>"Good." Now <em>there</em> was a snappy answer. Yes, she was on a conversational roll, all right, a regular genius with words.<br><br>Tate grinned. "You seem to be in a hurry, so I won't hold you up. Tripp tells me you're training for a marathon." A brief, measured pause. Meaning what? "Really?"<br><br>"Really," Bex replied. She managed a small smile, friendly enough, but wobbly. "Nice to see you," she said, trying to distance herself from him, still running. Still going nowhere fast. "What can I say? Guess I'm a glutton for punishment." <em>Terrific. More snappy repartee.</em> Annoyed with herself, she sprinted off, probably improving her time slightly, since she didn't particularly want him to remember her with a shiny face and a messy ponytail.<br><br>Of all the luck.<br><br>Make that <em>bad</em> luck.<br><br>Tate was tempting as hell, no denying that, but Bex got the nearly subliminal impression that he was as wary of involvement as she was. His wife had died, and she'd lost Will in Afghanistan&#x2014;it wasn't hard to do the psychological math.<br><br>Thoughts in a muddle, Bex finished her run and headed for home. There, she took a hot shower, put on her favorite red sweater and black jeans and, perhaps as a nod to the cosmic forces that governed vanity, she spent a few extra minutes doing her hair and adding lip gloss.<br><br>Satisfied that she looked okay, Bex left the house, got into her sporty SUV and, after making a brief stop downtown, zipped off to meet Mel and Hadleigh.<br><br>Reaching the Galloway ranch minutes later, Bex felt a twinge, a bittersweet sensation somewhere in the back of her heart. Tucked among the looming mountains, crystalline streams and venerable trees, the house and barn and other outbuildings&#x2014;even the fences and corrals&#x2014;seemed to <em>belong</em> there, organic to the landscape itself.<br><br>Tripp had taken over the place after his stepfather, Jim, long a widower, had finally remarried and moved into town. The house itself wasn't fancy, but it was spacious and solid and homey, with a welcoming air.<br><br>Secretly, Bex had always wanted to live in the country. She loved her work, felt she was making a genuine contribution to people's health and all-around well-being by furthering the cause of fitness through her ever-expanding business. And, if not actually country, Mustang Creek was certainly no clamoring metropolis. There was something...<em>nurturing</em> about being out here, with all this unspoiled nature.<br><br>Before she could even get out of the car, Mel and Hadleigh stepped onto the side porch, smiling and waving.<br><br>Both her friends were pregnant, and both of them were more beautiful than ever.<br><br>Bex felt a pang of affection, tinged, alas, with mild envy.<br><br>Hadleigh was farther along than Melody, her baby bump more pronounced. She'd married first, and she and Tripp had been eager to start their family.<br><br>All systems go.<br><br>Melody, running a close second, was just starting to show, a bit rounder than usual, her loose shirt disguising her pregnancy. If you didn't know her, you'd never guess, but they'd all been friends since they were six years old, so Bex was attuned to every change. She was living this with them, sharing the experience in a way, and she couldn't have been more pleased by their obvious happiness.<br><br>They really did glow.<br><br>They knew Bex felt slightly left out&#x2014;there wasn't much Melody and Hadleigh <em>didn't</em> know about her&#x2014;and they not only understood, they were also convinced her turn at marital bliss and motherhood would come. Soon.<br><br>When Bex's own hopes flagged, these two never failed to notice and offer encouragement. She was so lucky to have them in her life.<br><br>That choked her up for a moment, brought the sting of tears to her eyes. Romantic flings, career highs, fun times&#x2014;all those things came and went, but friendships like theirs were as permanent as bedrock.<br><br>She paused, took a breath and squared her shoulders.<br><br>"I brought dessert," she announced cheerfully. "Don't kill me, but it's those puff pastries from Madeline's. You guys can't drink wine or coffee, so you need <em>some</em> sort of vice." She paused, chuckling. Some fitness guru <em>she</em> was, she thought wryly. "One pastry won't hurt." This was true enough, in her opinion. One pastry <em>wouldn't</em> do any harm. The problem arose when the rate of consumption ratcheted up to three or four tasty treats&#x2014;or ten. Feeling cocky, she added, "Considering that I just ran eighteen miles, I can afford a reasonable level of indulgence."<br><br><em>Motormouth,</em> her inner moderator gibed.<br><br>"Give me that bag." Hadleigh grabbed for it as Bex came up the steps. "I'm having mine <em>before</em> lunch, so no lectures on nutrition, please. And if Tripp has the gall to say a word&#x2014;he has the metabolism of a shark, the rat fink&#x2014;I consider it your solemn duty as my friends to drop him in his tracks." Paper rustled as she peered inside the bag. Sniffed appreciatively. "Oh, dear heaven," she lamented happily, in a near moan, nudging Melody lightly with one elbow as she spoke, "it's the ones with lemon whipped cream."<br><br>"Yep," Bex confirmed with a twinkle. Judging by the current reactions, if she hadn't surrendered the bag willingly, one or both of these watermelon smugglers would have tackled her for it.<br><br>Melody, feigning greed, made a comical effort to snatch the fragrant sack from Hadleigh's hands, and Hadleigh, in turn, pretended to dodge the move.<br><br>"Hey, share and share alike," Melody said with a grin. "If you think you're going to snarf up my share right along with your own, sister, think again."<br><br>Hadleigh laughed, still employing diversion tactics, an awkward endeavor under the circumstances, and Bex wondered if the third pastry, intended to be hers, would survive this good-natured tussle.<br><br>Hadleigh correctly read Bex's expression. Yes, she was fit and yes, she ran a fitness empire, but she loved Madeline's lemon-cream dreams as much as anybody did. <em>"You</em> can drink wine," Hadleigh continued, cheerfully accusatory. <em>"We</em> can't. Coffee?" She waved one hand in a dismissive gesture while holding the pastry bag just out of Melody's reach with the other. "Gone. A distant memory."<br><br>Bex had to giggle at her friend's histrionics.<br><br>Hadleigh took in her friend's trim figure with a mock glower. "Laugh if you want, Becca Jean Stuart, but one of these days, you'll be pregnant and craving all kinds of things you can't have, and we'll be the ones rubbing it in."<br><br>"Yeah," Melody agreed staunchly, making another grab for the bag.<br><br>For all the joking around, a whisper of sadness brushed Bex's soul.<br><br>If Will, Hadleigh's older brother and the love of Bex's life, had made it home from Afghanistan, everything would be so different.<br><br>She'd loved Will Stevens so much.<br><br>Maybe the phrase, "better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all," was poignant, but it really didn't offer much comfort in reflective moments like this one.<br><br><em>Tough up, woman,</em> Bex told herself. Then, after a beat or two, when she could trust her voice again, she went on. "Once you two get a handle on dessert, what's on the menu for lunch?" she teased. "I heard a rumor that we were going to eat an actual meal, and I could use some sustenance here."<br><br>Hadleigh closed the bakery bag and rolled it shut with a little sigh of resignation. "I made spinach lasagna," she answered. "Garlic bread, too. The guys will be here soon, so maybe we ought to fill our plates before they get back with the boys."<br><br><em>"Boys?"</em> Bex asked cautiously. <em>Guys</em> usually meant Tripp and Spence. <em>Boys</em> implied someone else.<br><br>"Tate and his sons," Hadleigh explained airily.<br><br>It figured, Bex thought, unsurprised. She was going to have to deal with Tate Calder <em>twice</em> in one day? Just one more indication that God had a sense of humor.<br><br><em>Cosmic complaints department? This is Bex Stuart and I&#x2014;</em><br><br><em>Please hold for the next available operator. Your call is very important to us...</em><br><br>There she was. Again.<br><br>Tate had spotted Becca right away, back at the park. With looks like hers, she would've been hard to miss. She was trim, compact, with the kind of curves that drew a man's eye, even beneath baggy sweatpants and a faded T-shirt. And then there was all that silky hair, trying to fight its way out of a crooked ponytail.<br><br>At the time, he'd hesitated to say anything because he was rusty, to say the least, when it came to the whole man-woman interaction thing. Out of practice.<br><br>This <em>particular</em> woman stirred him, deep down, in ways he couldn't quite explain, rational thinker that he was. She made him want to take chances again, live for himself as well as his children.<br><br>But what if he fell for Becca&#x2014;Bex, as the others called her&#x2014;and his young sons got their hopes up, let down their guard, started to believe they might have a mother again, only to see the whole thing crash and burn? Would there be survivors?<br><br>He had no choice but to be philosophical.<br><br>Like it or not&#x2014;Tate both did and <em>didn't</em> like it&#x2014;he and Bex were face-to-face again.<br><br>The boys had both scrambled out of the truck the minute he pulled to a stop. He was grateful that they enjoyed visiting the ranch so much, and were distracted, as always, by the dogs and horses and all that space to run wild in. It meant the kids probably hadn't noticed that their dad had been flash frozen before their very eyes.<br><br>Tate worked up a smile, acknowledging Tripp and Hadleigh and Melody and Spence's existence with a slight wave of one hand as he approached them. Odd, how, just a moment before, he'd been so focused on Bex that she might've been standing all alone on the ranch house porch.<br><br>In fact, she might have been the only other human being on the planet.<br><br>Still, he was nothing if not a left-brained realist, and his attention had slowly widened, after that first weird instant, to include the others.<br><br>The cognitive dials in his head began to click, registering further details. Construction had started on the new house, for one thing.<br><br>Tripp and Spence looked like what they were&#x2014;happily married men. <em>Satisfied</em> men, maybe even a little smug.<br><br>Their wives, he noted, were downright radiant, the way women tended to be when they were not only cherished by their husbands, but gloriously pregnant, too.<br><br>And all the time he was formulating these observations, his sons were tearing around the yard with the dogs, overjoyed, high on blue skies and green grass and every blessing in between.<br><br>Of course, part of this boyish exuberance was for his benefit; Ben and Adam had been actively engaged in a campaign for a furry friend of their own for quite a while now. Although Tate wasn't averse to the idea&#x2014;he'd always loved animals himself&#x2014;they lived in a rented house, and the landlord didn't allow pets. So for the time being, anyway, adopting a critter was out of the question.<br><br>In the meanwhile, Muggles and Ridley filled the canine-companion bill.<br><br>Tate shifted mental gears, centering himself in the now. It was a beautiful afternoon, Ben and Adam were healthy, balanced kids and they were having fun.<br><br>Plus, they had a decent meal to look forward to. Tate's version of Saturday lunch was usually something along the lines of canned tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. He had the feeling that they'd get something a little more appealing from Hadleigh Galloway.<br><br>Inevitably, since Tate was flesh and blood, reasonably young and completely normal, his gaze strayed back to Bex. Ms. Stuart had looked two notches above terrific in her jogging clothes. Now, in a pair of well-cut jeans and a red sweater that showed off her feminine figure, she was downright distracting.<br><br>Just a few yards from the casual gathering on the porch, Tate almost froze again&#x2014;so much for getting centered&#x2014;but an amused, all-too-knowing glance from Tripp kept him moving forward.<br><br>"Hello again," he heard himself say, his voice sud...</p><h2>Miami Spice: The New Florida Cuisine (Steven Raichlen Barbecue Bible Cookbooks)</h2><p>The new star of the culinary galaxy is South Florida, declares The New York Times.

Unfortunately, it's also one which has been subject to far more speculation than sound biblical exegesis. Until now.<br><br>Unlike other resources available on the Antichrist, The Man of Sin focuses on Scripture, not contemporary events, to uncover the truth about this mysterious entity. With skilled exegesis Riddlebarger asserts that, contrary to popular speculation, the Antichrist is not a singular individual but a series of beings that will arise to challenge Christ throughout the inter-advental age before culminating in an end-times Antichrist. Backing this claim first in Scripture, Riddlebarger also draws from historical teachings including those of the church fathers, the Reformation, and historic Protestantism, before contrasting this evidence to the sensational interpretations of many contemporary writers. <br><br>Pastors, teachers, and study groups wanting to understand the doctrine of the Antichrist <br>will find The Man of Sin to be a unique and comprehensive study.</p><p>What should Christians believe about the Antichrist?<br><br>Christians have always been fascinated with the Antichrist, but recently the interest seems to have reached an all-time high, with pop culture depictions and speculation leaving many people confused or even frightened. But what does the Bible really say? What have Christians throughout history believed about the Antichrist? Should we fear the Antichrist or such things as the mark of the Beast? Have some end-times prophecies already been fulfilled? <br><br>Pastor and professor Kim Riddlebarger carefully untangles the confusion surrounding this biblical doctrine. He considers common beliefs about the Antichrist and end times, closely examines the relevant scriptural passages, and explains how these passages have been interpreted historically by the church. <br><br>Pastors, professors, and concerned Christians seeking trustworthy guidance on the doctrine of the Antichrist will appreciate Riddlebarger's sound biblical approach.<br><br>"Beyond sensationalism and silliness, this book on the Antichrist corrects a tendency among a lot of us simply to ignore the topic. Riddlebarger writes with accessible prose, although there is always more research and analysis behind it than meets the eye. If you want to learn about this strange New Testament figure without all the hype usually associated with the genre, look no further. It's serious, interesting, well-informed, and edifying reading."--Michael Horton, professor of theology and apologetics, Westminster Seminary California<br><br>Kim Riddlebarger (Ph.D., Fuller Theological Seminary) is senior pastor of Christ Reformed Church in Anaheim, California, and visiting professor of systematic theology at Westminster Seminary California.

Learn how plants and insects communicate through emissions in the infrared frequency range and why poisonous pesticides do not solve the real problems facing agriculture. In this breakthrough book Phil Callahan uncovers why certain insects are attracted only to certain plants, the role of pheromones work in nature, and how plants under stress literally signal insects to come devour them.

An internationally famous entomologist and ornithologist, he has been responsible for breakthrough discoveries in both areas. He is also an explorer who has walked across mainland China and the Syrian Desert, observing the intricate ways of man and nature wherever he went. <p>He entered the U.S. Army Air Force in 1942, and served two years in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. Hiking around the world after he war, he worked as a freelance photographer and writer. Later, he attended Fordham University and received his B.A. and M.S. degrees from the University of Arkansas and his Ph.D. from Kansas State University. He served as assistant professor of the Entomology Department at Louisiana State University and later joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Southern Grain Insects Research Laboratory as Project Leader for Insect Biophysics. He was also Professor of Entomology on the graduate faculty of the University of Georgia. In 1969 he transferred to USDA Insect Attractant and Behavior Laboratory at Gainesville, Florida. Callahan served as a full professor on the graduate faculty of the University of Florida, and on the staff of The Olive W. Garvey Center for the Improvement of Human Functioning, Inc. as an infrared systems and low energy consultant. </p><p>His research involved the utilization of nonlinear far infrared radiation by biological systems and its applications to insect control and medicine. He has developed theories of insect communication based on the waveguide characteristics of insect spines and has postulated that such spines are thermoelectret-coated dielectric waveguide aerials with the ability to receive short wavelength IR and microwave frequencies. His work in biophysics might best be called studies in insect molecular bioelectronics. </p><p>He is the author of more than 100 scientific papers and numerous books, including: My Search for Traces of God; A Walk in the Sun; Nature's Silent Music; Ancient Mysteries, Modern Visions; Tuning in to Nature; and, Paramagnetism.</p></p><h2>Sisters of the Spirit: Three Black Women&#39;s Autobiographies of the Nineteenth Century (Religion in North America)</h2><p><p>"Sisters of the Spirit... should interest a wider audience....

It explores aesthetic, spatial and experiential concepts by providing a structure through which landscapes can be understood and conceived in design. 'Fabric' is the integrated structure of whole landscapes, while 'form' refers to the components that make up this fabric. Together form and fabric create a morphology of landscape useful for the development of visual-spatial design thinking and awareness. This book is intended as both an introduction to the discipline for students of landscape architecture, architecture and planning, and a source of continuing interest for more experienced environmental designers.</p><p>Catherine Dee is Senior Lecturer in Landscape Design, Department of Landscape, University of Sheffield, UK."This book is one of those that should not be judged at face value.

This book will make you feel obliged to read on, just to check if there is an ingredient of landscape design to which you have so far been oblivious."<br>-Martin Hird, "Landscape Design 308, , March 2002 <br>"Dee (Univ. of Sheffield, UK) has produced a fascinating book with excellent and invaluable line drawings as an introduction for landscape students as well as those in architecture and planning.

Recent discoveries resulting from the excavation of the Templo Mayor in the heart of Mexico City have taught us even more about this fascinating culture. The increasing recognition that the achievements of Mesoamerican civilizations were among the most sophisticated of the ancient world has led to a demand for introductions to the basic methods and theories of scholars working throughout the region. <em>Handbook to Life in the Aztec World</em> gathers the results from recent archaeological discoveries and scholarly research into a single accessible volume. Organized thematically, the handbook covers all aspects of life in the Aztec world: Mesoamerican civilizations and Aztec archeology; evolution of Aztec civilization; geography of the Aztec world; society and government; religion, cosmology, and mythology; funerary beliefs and customs; Aztec art; Aztec architecture; Nahuatl literature; the calendar, astronomy, and mathematics; economy, industry, and trade; daily life; the Aztec after conquest and today. Each chapter includes an extensive bibliography, and more than 165 original line drawings, photographs, and maps complement the text. <em>Handbook to Life in the Aztec World</em> provides all the essential information required by anyone interested in Aztec history or culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Manuel Aguilar-Moreno</strong> is Associate Professor of Art History at California State University in Los Angeles.

It is arranged topically rather than dictionary-style, but it has a good index. Illustrations consist of line drawings and small photographs, and there are a few maps. There is a pronunciation guide for Nahuatl terms, which is very helpful. Facts are dependably presented, and there is a long bibliography.<p>Fourteen chapters cover topics such as "Geography of the Aztec World," "Warfare," "Aztec Architecture," and "Economy, Industry, and Trade." Each chapter is broken down into easily identified subentries; the chapter "Religion, Cosmology, and Mythology," for example, has sections on the structure of the Aztec universe, the main Aztec myths, the Aztec gods, rituals, and human sacrifice. The topical approach results in some repetition; for example, the <i>chinampas</i>, or floating gardens, that provided the Aztecs with more arable land are described in several places in the text. The writing is fairly academic. </p><p>Aguilar-Moreno is an associate professor of art history at California State University, Los Angeles, and his interest in art makes the chapters on art, architecture, and literature a substantial part of the work. He spends nearly as much time on the provenance of surviving Aztec codices as he does on the content of the literature. The chapter on architecture has a city-by-city description of major surviving Aztec architecture. The life of the people, on the other hand, is crowded into a single chapter on "Daily Life." A final chapter summarizes post-conquest Aztec contributions to Mexican society. One of the highlights at the end of the book is an appendix of Aztec poems in English. </p><p>Suitable for larger public libraries and academic libraries with undergraduate courses in Mesoamerican history, this volume complements <i>The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures: The Civilizations of Mexico and South America</i> (2001). <i>Kathleen Stipek</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Like John Milton, Sidney revered and idealized the Commonwealth (1649&#x2013;1660) as England's noble achievement in the grand tradition of ancient Greece and Rome.</p> <p>Sidney's treatise was published posthumously in 1698, fifteen years after he was executed for complicity in a plot to assassinate Charles II. Sidney's papers, including a draft of the <b><i>Discourses,</i></b> were used as evidence against him. Although there is nothing in the work incompatible with constitutional monarchy, the indictment claimed that it was a "false, seditious, and traitorous libel," citing sentences which stated that the king is subject to law and is responsible to the people.</p> <p>Sidney's <b><i>Discourses</i></b> was widely read in the colonies and influenced a number of American revolutionary leaders.</p> <p><b>Thomas G.

From the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries, they ruled much of Central Europe, and for two centuries were also rulers of Spain. Through the Spanish connection, they acquired lands around the Mediterranean and a chunk of the New World, spreading eastwards to include the Philippines. Reaching from South-East Asia to what is now Ukraine, the Habsburg Empire was truly global. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Martin Rady looks at the history of the Habsburgs, from their tenth-century origins in Switzerland, to the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire in 1918. He introduces the pantheon of Habsburg rulers, which included adventurers, lunatics, and at least one monarch who was so malformed that his true portrait could never be exhibited. He also discusses the lands and kingdoms that made up the Habsburg Empire, and the decisive moments that shaped their history. Dynasty, Europe, global power, and the idea of the multi-national state all converge on the history of the Habsburg Empire.

Are utopias benign or dangerous? Is the idea of utopianism essential to Christianity or heretical? What is the relationship between utopia and ideology? In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Lyman Sargent, one of the leading scholars in the field of utopian studies, explores these issues and examines utopianism and its history, discussing the role of utopianism in literature and in the development of colonies and in immigration. The idea of utopia has become commonplace in social and political thought, both negatively and positively. Sargent notes that some thinkers see a trajectory from utopia to totalitarianism, with violence an inevitable part of the mix. Others see utopia directly connected to freedom and as a necessary element in the fight against totalitarianism. In Christianity, utopia is labeled as both heretical and as a fundamental part of Christian belief, and such debates are also central to such fields as architecture, town and city planning, and sociology among many others. Sargent addresses all these issues in this clear, compact introduction.<br></p><p><br>Lyman Sargent is a Fellow of the Stout Research Centre at the Victoria University of Wellington and a Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

In April 1868, a very young John Muir stepped off a boat in San Francisco and inquired about the quickest way out of town. &#x201c;But where do you want to go?&#x201d; was the response, to which Muir replied, &#x201c;Anywhere that is wild.&#x201d; Using Muir&#x2019;s personal correspondence and published articles, Peter and Donna Thomas have reconstructed the real story of Muir&#x2019;s literal ramblings over California hills and through dales, with lofty Sierra Nevada peaks, Englishmen, and bears mixed in for good measure. The trip is illustrated by charming cut-paper illustrations that take their inspiration from Muir's love of nature. John Muir&#x2019;s story-telling is so compelling that even 150 years later, seeing the world through his eyes makes us want to head out into the wild.</p><p><b>Peter and Donna Thomas</b> are book artists. In 2006 they walked from San Francisco to Yosemite following the footsteps of John Muir on his first trip to Yosemite and later published a guidebook for following this route. Since 2010, they have traveled the United States as &#x201c;Wandering Book Artists,&#x201d; giving talks, workshops, and demonstrations.Introduction<br>What follows is the story of John Muir&#x2019;s 1868 walk across California from San Francisco to Yosemite. John Muir, noted naturalist, writer, and father of the worldwide conservation movement, was born in Scotland in 1838. His family immigrated to America in 1849 and settled near Portage, Wisconsin. Muir grew up as a hard-working farm boy with a deep, abiding love of nature. He proved to be an able inventor, creating machines composed of whittled cogs and levers to perform various semipractical operations, like a mechanism that connected a clock to his bed and tipped him out when it was time to rise. When he was twenty-two, he entered the University of Wisconsin, studying the natural sciences and intending to become a physician as a way to help humanity. Then, as part of his eclectic, self-directed education, Muir began to study botany. In the summer of 1863, he set off on his first long walk, accompanied by two fellow students; it was a botanical and geological tour down the Wisconsin River Valley and into Iowa. On completing this trip, instead of returning to school, he set out on another walking trip, this time from Wisconsin to Canada, into what he called &#x201c;the University of the Wilderness.&#x201d;<br>It is interesting to contemplate that John Muir might never have come to California to take <i>this walk&#x2014;and thus, might never have been in the position to influence President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside Yosemite as a national park&#x2014;if he hadn&#x2019;t first had an accident. In 1867, after returning home from his walk to Canada, Muir took a job in a wagon-wheel factory in Indianapolis and, while at work one day, pierced his right eye with an awl. Both eyes went blind. Muir, whose passion at this time was botany, vowed if he ever recovered his sight, he would not return to work on his mechanical inventions but would travel the world, and &#x201c;devote the rest of my life to the study of the inventions of God.&#x201d;<br>Fortunately, his eyesight <i>did</i> return; and soon after, he set off, walking from Indianapolis to the Gulf of Mexico with the intention to go on to South America and the source of the Amazon, where he would build a raft and float to the Atlantic. But Muir contracted malaria in Florida and changed his plans: &#x201c;I decided to visit California for a year or two to see its wonderful flora and the famous Yosemite Valley. All the world was before me and every day was a holiday, so it did not seem important to which one of the world&#x2019;s wildernesses I first should wander.&#x201d;<br>The Book Muir Did Not Write<br>John Muir wrote many books and articles during his lifetime. Some were autobiographical, some told tall tales of his adventures in the wilderness, and some shared his observations of nature. But he never wrote a book that told about his 1868 ramble across California to see Yosemite and the giant trees of the Mariposa Grove. When he was alive, it was not a story that would have interested many people. Back when there was still plenty of open space in California&#x2014;when the roads were lined with natural beauty and walking along them was not so unsafe&#x2014;people would have wanted to read of an epic adventure in the wilderness rather than a story about trying to <i>get</i> to the wilderness. But time has changed things; and now, if someone walks from San Francisco to Yosemite, it is a story worth telling. In fact, it is front-page news. We know that is true because it happened to us.</i></p><h2>Choices (Valdemar Anthologies)</h2><p><b>The twelfth anthology of short stories set in the beloved Valdemar universe, featuring stories by debut and established authors and a brand-new story from Lackey herself.</b><br><br>The Heralds of Valdemar are the kingdom's ancient order of protectors.

He, Uli, and Uli&#x2019;s older brother, Cyrus, all stood in the hold&#x2019;s great hall, a place where the Norton fam�ily had gathered since bringing their family&#x2019;s wood�craft from Hardorn to Valdemar. The interior had been built with the famous Norton oak, walls stained and oiled through the decades, standing as testament to the family&#x2019;s craftsmanship. Ceiling to floor tapes�tries adorned three of the walls, depicting the arrival of the Nortons, the harvesting of trees, and the annual replanting begun by the first Father after the first winter.<br> It was all there. The history of Uli&#x2019;s family. And it was under his ancestors&#x2019; gaze that he had just learned his estranged father, the man who had cursed him for being Chosen by a &#x201c;magic horse,&#x201d; had dismissed him as no longer being a part of the family . . . of their Hold.<br> Uli held up his hand, aware that he stood out among his family, dressed in his Herald Whites. He&#x2019;d donned a clean set at a nearby Waystation on his way from the Collegium. Just returned from a two- year Circuit, Uli had rested enough to satisfy the Healer before answer�ing an urgent summons home. He had secretly hoped the message, though not signed by his father, had come from Cade Norton so that he and his middle child could hopefully . . . mend fences.<br> But that was never going to happen.<br> &#x201c;Uli,&#x201d; Cyrus said, his rough, callused hands on his hips. &#x201c;Are you crying? You&#x2019;d think after eight years in that fancy school, you&#x2019;d at least learn how to be a man.&#x201d;<br> <i>:It seems Cyrus is still angry,: </i>Sillvrenniel spoke with an almost scolding tone. She had been stabled away from the rest of the Norton horses and now ran in the field amid the tall, strong trees of the north.<br> <i>:He will always be angry,: </i>Uli thought back. <i>:Cyrus will never forgive me for leaving.:</i><br> <i>:I do not think that is where this anger is coming from.:</i><br> <i>:Oh?:</i><br> Her voice took on a mothering tone. <i>:Dry those eyes and pay attention. It is important.:</i><br> His uncle and brother were watching him. He was sure they&#x2019;d noticed the faraway look in his eyes as he spoke to Sillvrenniel. &#x201c;Tears are an expression of emo�tion, Brother. You have known of our father&#x2019;s death for a year. And yet I have just learned of the tragedy upon walking into this room. Surely when you heard, you shed at least one tear for the man who raised you? Pro�tected you?&#x201d;<br> Uli had struck a nerve, and he knew it when he looked into Cyrus&#x2019; eyes. They narrowed as Cyrus low�ered his hands to his sides and balled them into fists.<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough,&#x201d; Osric said, his hands up as he moved between the two of them. &#x201c;Arguments have no place here. Not now.&#x201d; He turned to Uli. &#x201c;It is good to see you well, Uli. Though you do look tired. It is there, behind your eyes. I heard you&#x2019;ve been on what they refer to as a Circuit?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Uncle. An apprenticeship.&#x201d; He and Osric had always been close, even when Uli&#x2019;s own father had looked at his son with disgust. Osric had always seemed to know when the two had argued and had sought out Uli to comfort him, making excuses for his own brother&#x2019;s behavior. Osric had been the one to es�cort a much younger Uli to Haven after Sillvrenniel had Chosen him, claiming to be proud there was a Herald in the Norton line. &#x201c;I was paired with Herald Cerys for the last year of the Circuit. We traveled around the east, close to the border.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Is this Cerys a woman or a man?&#x201d; Cyrus said.<br> &#x201c;Herald Cerys is a woman,&#x201d; Uli said, but did not look at Cyrus. &#x201c;She is gifted with Farsight, which works well with my own gift.&#x201d;<br> Osric clapped his hands together. &#x201c;Then the reports that you have found stolen items are true?&#x201d;<br> Uli hesitated. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t aware there were reports.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I have always kept an eye on you, Uli.&#x201d; Osric crossed his arms over his chest.<br> Uli smiled and blinked back tears. &#x201c;You were al�ways more of a father to me.&#x201d;<br> Cyrus snorted. &#x201c;So we&#x2019;re back to that, are we? Fa�ther never loved me enough.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Cyrus,&#x201d; Osric looked his nephew. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d;<br> To Uli&#x2019;s surprise, his brother didn&#x2019;t say another word. Cyrus had always been outspoken and verbally abusive since he could put words together. To see him actually stop talking because their uncle commanded him came as a surprise. Things had changed in the Norton Hold.<br> &#x201c;Uli, I kept up with you because I wanted to know how you were doing. What you were doing. And where you were.&#x201d; Osric dipped his head and raised his shoulders. <br> &#x201c;Unfortunately . . . on occasion I lost track of you. Her�alds are good at disappearing when they need to.&#x201d;<br> That much was true. And while traveling together, he and Cerys had made a few enemies and found it necessary to veer off their chosen path to protect themselves and their Companions. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you send word when he died?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I did,&#x201d; Osric said. &#x201c;But there was no response. So after three days of mourning, it was time to put your father to rest. He&#x2019;s in the chapel crypt if you would like to pay your respects. But first, I must discuss with you the reason you are here.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Uncle&#x2014;&#x201d; Cyrus said abruptly.<br> &#x201c;You can go, Cyrus. Now.&#x201d;<br> Uli looked at his brother and saw the blaze in Cyrus&#x2019; eyes as he glanced at Osric. Cyrus bowed to his uncle, then shot a withering glance at Uli and stalked out of the room, slamming the door upon his exit.<br> &#x201c;I see my brother&#x2019;s temper hasn&#x2019;t changed,&#x201d; Uli muttered.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid not.&#x201d; Osric motioned to the fire at the other end of the hall, and the two walked over and sat at a bench. Two women brought out a flagon of water and cups, a bowl of cheese and grapes, and a loaf of hot bread. Osric poured water and then gestured for Uli to break bread. &#x201c;Will you be wearing those clothes the whole time you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Only on official Herald business,&#x201d; Uli didn&#x2019;t have to force a smile. He was among the many Heralds who thought the Whites a bit too . . . ostentatious. As well as absurdly visible. It was the equivalent of wearing a target. &#x201c;Uncle,&#x201d; he paused after breaking the bread in half. He really didn&#x2019;t have an appetite. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you keep sending me messages?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Once the first message about Father&#x2019;s death failed to reach me, why not send more? Why wait for a year before bringing me home?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Things aren&#x2019;t as . . .&#x201d; He set a cup in front of Uli. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that simple, dear boy. Your father&#x2019;s death was sudden, and it destabilized the business for a while. You remember the Ohbokhens?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, one of the other woodcrafters near Delcaire. I remember father mentioning they were here before the Nortons came.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Aye. Before his death, Cade shared something with me. Master Sorenson found his physical inventory didn&#x2019;t match what the accounting reported. He showed Cade and together the two of them did a physical au�dit. When they were done, Cade said half a year&#x2019;s wood and the equivalent in income were missing, even though the records said otherwise.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Who was doing the bookkeeping?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Cyrus.&#x201d;<br> Uli&#x2019;s eyes widened.<br> Osric continued, &#x201c;Sorenson noticed the discrepancy because several large orders couldn&#x2019;t be fulfilled. The ledgers said we had enough wood, but that wasn&#x2019;t the case. The merchants were angry, and they took their business to Stanis Ohbokhen.&#x201d;<br> Uli put his hands on the table. &#x201c;Did father confront Cyrus?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Cade died two days later.&#x201d; Osric shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you didn&#x2019;t know this, but your father didn&#x2019;t leave Cyrus in charge of the company, Uli. He left it to Eda to run.&#x201d;<br> Eda. Uli&#x2019;s younger sister. &#x201c;Eda?&#x201d; He looked around. &#x201c;Where is Eda? How come she&#x2019;s not here?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She hasn&#x2019;t been here in over a month.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2014;&#x201d; Uli searched his uncle&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s go�ing on, Uncle? Why isn&#x2019;t Eda here if Father left the business to her? And why hasn&#x2019;t someone confronted Cyrus about the loss?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Because after your father died, Eda managed to build the business back up again, and we regained our reputation. But then a month ago we uncovered evidence that Eda had been selling that wood to Stanis Ohbokhen and pocketing the money. The Healer also kept evidence of Cade&#x2019;s murder from the public. But I knew of it, and so did Cyrus. Eda killed your father because he found out what she was doing and threat�ened to disown her.&#x201d;<br> Uli slowly stood and stepped away from the bench. &#x201c;You said Father died. You didn&#x2019;t say he was killed.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Uli&#x2014;this is why I requested you come home. This is why I need you as a Herald.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you&#x2014;Eda would never have hurt Father.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We have evidence that she poisoned him, Uli. When she was confronted, she fled, and we haven&#x2019;t been able to find her since.&#x201d; Osric stood and also stepped away from the bench. &#x201c;Herald Uli, I request you find Eda Norton and bring her back to Norton Hold to stand trial for the murder of your father, Cade Norton.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Ego in Freud&#39;s Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis, 1954-1955 (Seminar of Jacques Lacan (Paperback)) (Book II)</h2><p>A complete translation of the seminar that Jacques Lacan gave in the course of a year&#39;s teaching within the training programme of the Socie&#39;te&#39; Francaise de Psychanalyse.

The path is vague, however, and certainly treacherous as it takes him into strange territories that, quite literally, no one has ever seen before. The task is too dangerous to venture upon alone, so he must seek assistance, comrades for the coming travails.</p><p>So assisted&#x2015;ably and otherwise&#x2015;by his vampiric brother, Horst, and by the kindly accompaniment of a criminologist and a devil, he will encounter ruins and diableries, mystery and murder, the depths of the lowest pit and a city of horrors. London, to be exact.</p><p>Yet even though Cabal has risked such peril believing he understands the dangers he faces, he is still underestimating them. He is walking into a trap of such arcane complexity that even the one who drew him there has no idea of its true terrors. As the snare closes slowly and subtly around them, it may be that there will be no survivors at all.</p><p><i>The Fall of the House of Cabal </i>is the fifth book in Jonathan L.

Cabal remains an entertaining antihero whose complexities have deepened over time, and the conclusion of the narrative threads that have spanned the previous four Cabal books is both satisfying and touching." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Howard makes it look easy to paint a soul-stealing, murdering necromancer as a sympathetic character; that, folks, is worth the price of admission." &#x2015;<i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i></p><p>"Howard is a supremely talented writer and the Johannes Cabal series makes for superb reading. It would be easy at this point to say if you like Rankin or Fforde or Pratchett or Holt, then you will love these books, but while it may well be true, it would be doing Howard a disservice." &#x2015;<i>Sci-Fi-London</i></p><p>"Howard's Dreamlands will thrill fans of H.P.

For more, visit dharmaocean.org.</p>Ray, a student of Tibetan Buddhist master Ch�gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, has written several other books and very evidently knows a great deal about meditation and the Tibetan Buddhist tradition as passed down by his unconventional guru. This book about the ultimate nonconceptual wisdom&#x2014;what we can know in our bodies &#x2014;is, paradoxically, highly conceptual and very slow going. The prose is labored (a clear and accurate conceptual understanding of the subtle processes involved is necessary so we have the apparatus to receive, comprehend and give voice to our experience). Frequently, Buddhist teachers use concrete examples or real-life stories to illustrate difficult or subtle points. Ray shares one important anecdote from his own life, but more tales from his or his students' lives would help. The critique of Western overdependence on thinking is certainly familiar, so the author's starting point is not new. The visualization exercises he offers in the book's appendix are comparatively fresh. But these instructions are probably more effective heard than read, and Ray's publisher indeed offers an audio program of related meditation practices. This book could use hard editing and clearer, more concrete language and examples. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Quietly subversive, brilliantly analytical, and haunted by melancholy, Arkady Renko survived, barely, the journey from the Soviet Union to the New Russia, only to find his transformed nation just as obsessed with corruption and brutality as was the old Communist dictatorship.<br> <br>In <i>Wolves Eat Dogs</i>, Renko returns for his most enigmatic and baffling case yet: the death of one of Russia&#x2019;s new billionaires, which leads him to Chernobyl and the Zone of Exclusion&#x2014;closed to the world since 1986&#x2019;s nuclear disaster. It is still aglow with radioactivity, now inhabited only by the militia, shady scavengers, a few reckless scientists, and some elderly peasants who refuse to relocate. Renko&#x2019;s journey to this ghostly netherworld, the crimes he uncovers there, and the secrets they reveal about the New Russia make for an unforgettable adventure.</p><p>"Why would anyone jump out a window with a saltshaker?" A good question, especially when the suicide victim is Pasha Ivanov, a Moscow physicist-turned-billionaire businessman--a "New Russian" poster boy, if ever there was one--with several homes, a leggy 20-year-old girlfriend ("the kind [of blonde] who could summon the attention of a breeze"), and every reason to be contented in his middle age. So, wonders Senior Investigator Arkady Renko, in Martin Cruz Smith's <i>Wolves Eat Dogs</i>, what provoked Ivanov to take a header from his stylish 10th-floor apartment? And how does it relate to the shaker clutched in his dead hand or the hillock of table salt found on his closet floor?<p> Renko, introduced in Smith's 1981 bestseller, <i>Gorky Park</i>, is a cop well out of sync with rapidly changing Russian society, "a difficult investigator, a holdover from the Soviet era, a man on the skids" whose determination to do more than go through the motions of criminal inquiries inevitably exasperates his superiors. Thus, when this saturnine detective declines to accept the verdict that Ivanov did himself in--who peppered that salt around the capitalist's premises, Renko still wants to know, and what about rumors of a security breach at Ivanov's apartment building?--he is exiled to the Ukrainian Zone of Exclusion, the "radioactive wasteland" surrounding Chernobyl, site of a notorious 1986 nuclear disaster and the place where, only a week after Ivanov's demise, his company's senior vice-president is found with his throat slit. There, among cynical scientists, entrepreneurial scavengers, and predators both two- and four-legged--an exclusive coterie of the rejected--Renko chews over the crimes on his plate. Unfortunately, the dosimeter that warns him of radiation exposure at Chernobyl does not also protect him from a pair of malevolent brothers, or a "damaged" woman doctor offering him mutually assured disappointment.</p><p> Smith has a keen eye for the comical quirks of modern-day Russia--its chaotic roadways, voracious appetite for post-communist luxuries, and evolving ethics ("Russians used to kill for women or power, real reasons. Now they kill for money"). And this story's bleakly beautiful Ukrainian backdrop nicely complements the desperate hope of Renko's task. Still, the greatest strength of <i>Wolves Eat Dogs</i> (Smith's fifth series installment, after <i>Havana Bay</i>) is its characters, especially Arkady Renko, who despite his lugubrious nature continues to show a heart as expansive and unfathomable as the Siberia steppe. <i>--J.

Her sleep-dream experience on a summer evening is a conversational interplay of her youthful imagination with family, neighbors, animals and nature's musical background.

Bright foregrounds are balanced by darker backgrounds of starry night skies to reinforce awareness of the time for sleep and dreams.

Since 2016, Salena has joined the <i>New York Post</i>, acts as a CNN political analyst, and a staff reporter and columnist for the <i>Washington Examiner</i>. <br><br><b>Brad Todd,</b> a sixth-generation native of rural East Tennessee, is a founding partner at OnMessage media firm. His candidate clients have included six U.S. Senators, three Governors, and more than two dozen congressmen.1<br><br>Hidden in Plain Sight<br><br>Jefferson, Ashtabula County, Ohio&#x2014;It is 1:45 in the morning and Bonnie Smith&#x2019;s alarm has just gone off. That alarm is a reminder that, seven days a week, she is living her lifelong dream of owning a bakery.<br><br>&#x201c;I come in at two-�thirty in the morning. We start making doughnuts from scratch. After that, I go into the breads and pies or whatever I have going out&#x2014;�like right now I need to do cupcakes, and I have a couple pies I have to put out, but I also have to check what orders are going out. Then we start soups, and by eleven o&#x2019;clock we start lunch,&#x201d; she explains.<br><br>At sixty-�three, she is two years into her second career in the small town of Jefferson, running a Chestnut Street bakery that is a throwback to simpler times: pretty pink-�and-�green wallpaper decorated with cupcakes surrounds a fireplace and tables and chairs that fill the front of the bakery.<br><br>By 9:00&nbsp;a.m., already half of her sugar cookies, tea cakes, cream wafers, brownies, mini tarts, and thumbprints are gone. With the help of her grandson, a fresh batch of sugary glazed doughnuts makes its way from the kitchen to a tray in the display case.<br><br>The aroma is irresistible and intoxicating and gently teases the senses.<br><br>A young mother enters with her three-�year-�old daughter, Evelyn, who immediately makes a beeline to the display case filled with color�ful cookies and pastries and, with the willfulness and determination only a toddler possesses, plants her face against the case to get a closer look at the cupcake with rainbow sprinkles on top.<br><br>To the girl&#x2019;s delight, Smith hands her the confection, and minutes later Evelyn&#x2019;s face and fingers are covered in pink icing. The imprint of her little face on the display case&#x2014;�a smudged outline of a tiny nose and lips&#x2014;�makes Smith smile broadly.<br><br>As Smith started making soup for the anticipated lunch crowd, the diminutive brunette was sporting a white apron with legally sweet embroidered across the front, the name of her shop and a hat tip to her thirty-�plus years at the Ashtabula County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office.<br><br>She started working as a cook in the sheriff&#x2019;s department when the youngest of her three children was five years old. It was the same job her mother had.<br><br>But Smith wanted more.<br><br>So she went back to school for criminal law while she worked as a cook in the courthouse. She then moved over to dispatch and then up through the ranks in the sheriff&#x2019;s department until she made deputy, all the while raising her three children with her husband, an electrician for Millennium Inorganic Chemicals&#x2014;�one of the last big blue-�collar employers in the once-�mighty manufacturing county of Ashtabula, wedged between the shore of Lake Erie and the Pennsylvania state line, northeast of Cleveland.<br><br>Smith was raised a Democrat, her parents were Democrats, she is married to a Democrat, and she worked for elected Democratic sheriffs in a county that had not voted a Republican into local office for as long as anyone you find can remember.<br><br>Until 2016, that is, when Ashtabula picked Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton and swept in a local ticket of Republicans underneath him.<br><br>Bonnie Smith was one of the unlikely participants in that unforeseen realignment that happened across the Great Lakes region in hundreds of communities like Ashtabula County, flipping Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Iowa into the Republican side of the electoral college after serving as what journalist Ron Brownstein dubbed the reliable industrial Democratic &#x201c;Blue Wall&#x201d; for decades.1<br><br>How Democratic was Smith, and how recently? In March 2016, she voted for Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the Ohio primary contest. Voting Republican wasn&#x2019;t even on the table for her, until suddenly it was, just a few months later.<br><br>&#x201c;I am not sure what happened, but I started to look around me, and my town and my county, and I thought, &#x2018;You know what? I am just not in the mood anymore to just show up and vote for who my party tells me I have to vote for,&#x2019; &#x201d; she says.<br><br>She was not alone. Ashtabula County had given its votes to John Kerry, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, and Michael Dukakis. It gave Barack Obama a 55&nbsp;percent majority share of its vote twice&#x2014;�before turning 180 degrees to prefer Trump over Hillary Clinton by a margin of 57&nbsp;percent to 38&nbsp;percent, a 31-�point swing from one election to the next.<br><br>At first look, the numerical magnitude of Ashtabula&#x2019;s swing, in a nation presumed frozen in partisan polarization, is what seems notable. At second look, the remarkable aspect is just how common that kind of change was in 2016 in the states that make up the Rust Belt.<br><br>Thirty-�five counties in Ohio, long the nation&#x2019;s premier presidential bellwether, swung 25 or more points from 2012 to 2016. Twenty-�three counties in Wisconsin, thirty-�two counties in Iowa, and twelve counties in Michigan switched from Obama to Trump in the space of four years.<br><br>With few exceptions, these places are locales where most of America&#x2019;s decision makers and opinion leaders have never been. Trump only carried 3 of the nation&#x2019;s 44 &#x201c;mega counties,&#x201d; places with more than one million in population, and only 41 of the country&#x2019;s 129 &#x201c;extra large&#x201d; counties with more than 400,000 but less than one million. Those 173 sizable counties are home to 54&nbsp;percent of the U.S. population, and in 135 of them Trump even lagged behind the net margin performance of losing 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Trump crawled out of that mathematical hole in the all-�but-�forgotten communities&#x2014;�thousands of them.<br><br>It took a lot of Bonnie Smiths, in a lot of places like Ashtabula County, to wreck political expectations&#x2014;�and if their political behavior in 2016 becomes an affiliation and not a dalliance, they have the potential to realign the American political construct and perhaps the country&#x2019;s commercial and cultural presumptions as well.<br><br>For Smith, who lives with her husband, George, on a working farm in nearby Saybrook, the political tipping point&#x2014;�even more than the job losses and the decay of the area&#x2014;�was a result of her faith and her growing disconnect on cultural issues from the candidates she had previously supported.<br><br>&#x201c;I had looked the other way for far too long, had accepted that I was supposed to be more modern in my views when I wasn&#x2019;t comfortable with the views my party started to take,&#x201d; Smith says, making clear that this was a difficult decision to have made and to discuss publicly. &#x201c;And I took a stand for myself, my beliefs, for life, and for my country.&#x201d;<br><br>She says she also took a stand for her community: &#x201c;All of this decay has happened under their [the Democrats&#x2019;] watch.&#x201d;<br><br>The shopping district where Legally Sweet sits is struggling; a Family Dollar store is around the corner, and the majestic Ashtabula County courthouse, where she worked for years, is across the street. Shuttered businesses dot both sides of the street.<br><br>&#x201c;The town closes up about three o&#x2019;clock on the weekdays and, like, one o&#x2019;clock on Saturday. There&#x2019;s nothing here. The people come in and&nbsp;. . . you&#x2019;re making it but you&#x2019;re not. You know? You&#x2019;ve got enough to skimp by for the next day, but that&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>The statistics on the area&#x2019;s own economic development website paint a picture of an Ashtabula County stuck in transition and trying to creatively reinvent itself to get out of the Great Recession, from which the wealthier America on the East and West coasts recovered years ago. As of May 2016, the local economic partnership wrote that the county&#x2019;s employed workforce level was still stuck under 42,000 people&#x2014;�nearly the same figure as at the bottom of the national recession in 2010, a fall from 46,000 in its pre-�recession high.2 Nationally, the number of employed Americans had bounced back to pre-�recession levels by 2014.3<br><br>The physical reality of the county&#x2019;s industrial footprint tells the same story. Empty, idle, hulking coal-�fired power plants line the lakeshore, and the docks that once attracted waves of Italian and Scandinavian immigrants to unload coal and iron ore now see little activity. The county&#x2019;s population, according to the Census Bureau&#x2019;s 2016 estimates, is 98,231, almost exactly what it was after the 1970 census, a span that saw the country as a whole grow by 59&nbsp;percent.4<br><br>A Democrat for decades, Smith didn&#x2019;t quite know what to expect when she went home one day and told George she was thinking about supporting Trump. He told her he was already there. &#x201c;So there was that,&#x201d; she says, laughing.<br><br>w<br><br>America&#x2019;s political experts, from party leaders to political science professors to journalists to pundits, did not expect the Smiths, or enough people like them, to vote for Donald Trump. Virtually every political and media expert missed the potential of Donald Trump because they based their electoral calculus on assumptions that they hadn&#x2019;t bothered to check since the last presidential election. To recognize the potential of the Trump coalition, analysts would have had to visit places they had stopped visiting and listen to people they had stopped listening to.<br><br>&#x201c;I am kind of that voter that was hiding in plain sight that no one saw coming. I was right here all along. I&#x2019;ve seen the job losses here, the rise in crime, the meth and heroin problem, society essentially losing hope; something just gave in with me,&#x201d; Bonnie Smith says.<br><br>The political experts called the 2016 election wrong&#x2014;�not because they took too few polls or studied too many census trends, but because they assumed American elections were immune to the same changes wreaking havoc in every other part of American society.<br><br>Amazon is in the process of destroying Walmart and what is left of Main Street at the same time. Streaming services such as Netflix and YouTube are fragmenting and democratizing the creation and delivery of video entertainment. Person-�to-�person payment systems like PayPal and Venmo, and crowd-�sourced funding communities like GoFundMe and Kickstarter, are reshaping the movement of private capital. In virtually every sphere of American society, institutional loyalty and expert filtering are being discarded in favor of direct communication and deliberate silo-�ing. Similarly, Donald Trump&#x2019;s electoral coalition is smashing both American political parties and the previously impenetrable political news media, often in spite of Trump himself.<br><br>In the wake of the 2016 election surprise, the political experts have continued to blow it&#x2014;�looking to predict the coming demise of the president without pausing to consider the durability of the trends and winds that swept him into office. Even if Netflix disappears, traditional cable providers will never have the monopolistic hold on viewers they did twenty years ago. Similarly, after Trump, traditional political parties will not have the same sway with voters they&#x2019;ve had for past election cycles.<br><br>The history of the American electorate is not a litany of flukes; instead it is a cycle of tectonic plate&#x2013;�grinding, punctuated by a landscape-�altering earthquake every generation or so. This movement is not dissimilar to that of any other American consumer category; it should come as no surprise that electoral choices float and change in the same manner as other voluntary behaviors in the most open and dynamic market in the world.<br><br>Analysts of consumer-�product marketing make a distinction between category killers and category builders. Disruptive brands that merely reorient a single category are category killers: think Miller Lite beer, or diet soda. Meanwhile, products that are category builders do more, starting an entirely new marketplace: think Federal Express or Apple&#x2019;s iPad.<br><br>Political analysts across the spectrum have given Trump credit for being a category killer, reshaping Republican politics in his image. But the characteristics of his rise and the unique new coalition he fused in the Rust Belt argue that he should be viewed as a category builder, the first success of a coalition that is not likely to soon separate.<br><br>Employing direct marketing to the consumer instead of relying on referrals is a hallmark of category builders. Trump&#x2019;s favored message delivery mechanisms: Twitter, dominance of cable news even when it required self-�stoked controversy, and television-�friendly rallies not only cut against the normal practices of the professional campaign industry, they enabled him to outflank, and simultaneously own, his critics in the news media as well. Trump used the red-�hot scrutiny of journalists to polarize and galvanize a plurality of �voters in primary after primary, and then in the general election&#x2019;s key battle�grounds.<br><br>Attacking all existing brands with equal ease and success is another trait of category builders. Trump drove a wedge between �voters and the existing brands simultaneously, making the case that both parties were incapable of delivering his attributes. Trump&#x2019;s campaign was arguably the least partisan in recent memory because from the start he aimed his fire at both political trenches. By Election Day, Trump had vanquished not only the stale institutional hierarchy of the Democratic and Republican parties, exemplified perfectly by the gasping legacy brands of Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, but the entire national press corps as well.5<br><br>In his first campaign announcement speech in the lobby of Trump Tower in June 2016, Trump said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve watched the politicians. . . . They will never make America great again. They don&#x2019;t even have a chance. They&#x2019;re controlled fully&#x2014;�they&#x2019;re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.&#x201d;6 Trump, previewing his stamina for a slashing campaign that would leave him with few elected allies, said, &#x201c;This is going to be an election that&#x2019;s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they&#x2019;re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>Trump bore out his differentiation on the primary campaign trail for a year through Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and subsequent primaries, even creating a months-�long melodrama around the prospect that he might mount a third-�party bid if his effort at the GOP nomination was thwarted. Trump deftly used Republican elites, exemplified by the well-�off and well-�connected backers of Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, as foils, even daring to attack the donor-�heavy, in-�person audiences sitting just feet from him at the GOP&#x2019;s primary debates. What struck many as thin-�skinned rants turned out to be brand-�building, proving to Trump&#x2019;s most loyal followers that he was a different kind of Republican, one that wasn&#x2019;t much of a Republican at all.<br><br>For nearly a century, American politics has put the New Deal coalition of government takers on one side, opposed by the fusion of affluence and evangelicalism of the modern Republican Party. The coalition that elected Donald Trump&#x2014;�and the one that opposed him&#x2014;�fit neither of those blueprints.<br><br>James Carville, the architect of the first Clinton campaign in 1992, famously said that after five Republican victories in the prior six presidential elections, he and the Clinton team engineering what was then a novel Democratic victory &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t find the key to the electoral lock here.

Think of your three best friends. If they<br><br>are okay, then it's you.<br><br>-Rita Mae Brown<br><br>Are you saying that people will be happier if they shop less?" Judging from the way she was sneering at me across the faux-news desk, it was clear that the local noonday TV anchorwoman wasn't asking a rhetorical question. She looked like she'd bought-and was wearing-one of everything that QVC was selling that day. And her clothes clearly weren't all she'd bought. Her extensive cosmetic surgery reminded me of a roadside billboard I once saw for a plastic surgeon just across the border in Mexico: "U Pay 4 UR Face + Hips?. . . I do UR Breasts 4 Free!"<br><br>I'd endeared myself to her earlier by arriving for the interview on my bicycle, in a sweat-stained T-shirt. Suffice it to say that we came from different worlds.<br><br>"But shopping is what we do. Shopping is what makes us happy. Are you crazy?" she said, looking at me like I must have been hitting the box wine in the green room before the interview.<br><br>Well, the cheapskate's brain is definitely wired differently, of that I'm convinced. You don't need to spend much time around us or be trained as a psychiatrist (or local news anchor) to figure that out. Whether we're born that way or we pick up certain attitudes and beliefs about life as we go along, the cheapskate next door sees the world a bit differently than most folks.<br><br>Here's a brief tour of the cheapskate mindset-a synopsis of the sixteen key synapses that set the cheapskate next door apart from the typical American consumer.<br><br>1. The Joneses Can Kiss Our Assets<br><br>"Welcome to the Taj Mahovel!" Jacquie Phelan greeted me with a big smile and friendly hug on the doorstep of the eclectic house in Fairfax, California, where she's lived with her husband, Charlie, for the past twenty-six years.<br><br>As I'd driven down their street, I had trouble spotting addresses on the immaculately maintained, �ber-yuppiefied, overly remodeled houses that lined the pleasant lane. But when I saw the warren of little outbuildings strung together by pergolas constructed of every type of salvaged material imaginable, I knew I'd arrived at Jacquie's house. This was clearly the house of someone who wasn't concerned about what the Joneses think. This house had to belong to a cheapskate.<br><br>"A few years ago we heard a realtor walking past our house with some prospective buyers, and they were talking about how tacky some of the homes on the street are," Jacquie told me as we sat having lunch under a lean-to made of scrap lumber (aka "The Habitat") in their jungly side yard. "And I piped back to the real estate agent from inside the Habitat, 'It's going to stay that way, too!' "<br><br>My lunch with Jacquie and Charlie, by the way, was chicken soup and a truly tasty array of little finger foods, most of which<br><br>my Freegan hostess told me she'd salvaged the previous evening from dumpsters behind area markets. "Hmm?. . . ?trash-can tapas," I thought to myself. "There's a first time for everything." (Among other journalistic enterprises, Jacquie writes about her unique approach to food and cooking on her blog, "Salivation Army," at phelanfood.wordpress.com.)<br><br>Don't get me wrong: Jacquie and Charlie's house isn't a public hazard or anything like that. In fact, it's kind of cool and rather pretty in its own Hobbit-treehouse-ish way. It's just that it's a house designed to please the people who live in it, and not necessarily the people who live next door to it. According to Jacquie, it's also the couple's personal attempt to help "stem the seemingly inevitable shift of the neighborhood from a cozy place, filled with humble homes" into one of "investment (properties) for upwardly mobile but of course deeply-in- debt people" who have no time to become part of the community-and no intention of staying there once they can afford to move on and gentrify the next modest-but-content neighborhood.<br><br>Will Rogers once said, "Too many people spend money they haven't earned, to buy things they don't want, to impress people they don't like." Well, he wasn't talking about the cheapskates next door.<br><br>When asked the question "On a scale of one to ten, with one being not important at all and ten extremely important, how concerned are you about 'keeping up with the Joneses' (i.e., maintaining economic status/ appearances with your peers)?" roughly 85 percent of cheapskates ranked it as "one," not important at all. (Incidentally, of the remaining 15 percent of respondents, more than half took the liberty of going off the chart and rating it as a "zero" or even less!)<br><br>Because of the cheapskates' strong sense of self-worth, they rarely covet the lifestyle or material possessions of others, and have little desire to try to impress other people or keep up appearances. Dylan Davis, of Twinsburg, Ohio, wrote: "We make more money than almost everyone we know, but spend less than all of our peers?. . . neither of us cares what other people think about us."<br><br>That's not to say that cheapskates are always immune to peer pressure. And luckily, there are things you can do to ward off the big green monster when he does come calling.<br><br>Gerald Thomson told me about a time when his wife, Julia, came home from work feeling a little envious of the big homes some of her coworkers were buying. "She sat down at the computer and submitted our financial information to see how much of a mortgage we could qualify for. Once she saw that we could qualify to purchase a larger home, she felt better. As long as she knew we could keep up with the Joneses, but choose not to, she was able to keep focused on our early retirement goals."<br><br>2. A Cheapskate Values Time More than Money<br><br>In my conversations with the cheapskates next door, I was struck by how often they spoke about the value and cost of things not in terms of dollars and cents, but rather days and hours. It's like cheapskates have their own currency. They automatically convert the price of things into the currency of time-their own time.<br><br>We've always heard that "time is money." Cheapskates tend to reverse that axiom, making it "money is time." A new pair of boots might cost $150, but for Clara, the cheapskate who makes $32,000 a year, those boots cost close to two days of her time spent working in a job that she doesn't really enjoy. When Clara looks at it in those terms and considers what else she might do with that time and that money, she decides that her old boots will do just fine.<br><br>The idea of translating money into the cost of your time was popularized-and maybe pioneered-by Vicki Robin and the late Joe Dominguez in their bestselling book Your Money or Your Life (Penguin Books, reissued in 2008). The authors present various formulas and exercises to help readers determine the true value of their time-or "life energy," in the authors' words-and evaluate whether you're really getting the most value out of the limited time we all have here on Earth. This classic book is credited by many cheapskates, myself included, with fundamentally reshaping their attitude toward money and life, and it was one of the most frequently recommended reference books by those responding to my questionnaire.<br><br>It's not unusual to encounter cheapskates who actually carry around a card in their wallets or purses with a homemade conversion chart on it, showing how much they earn in their jobs by the minute, hour, day, week, and so on. "It helps to put the true cost<br><br>of things in perspective," one card-carrying cheapskate told me. "When I think of the joy I get out of having a day off with my kids, or reading, or relaxing, or whatever?. . . stuff and the cost it represents in terms of my time quickly loses its appeal. It just becomes too expensive."<br><br>The cheapskate next door also recognizes that, if you go about it wrong, frugality and saving money can be a time-suck in its own right. If instead of buying that $150 pair of new boots in the department store, Clara spends two days combing yard sales and thrift stores across the city to find a used pair for only $20, then in terms of time-value she'd have been better off just buying the new pair.<br><br>That's why the cheapskate next door is a "premeditated shopper" and not a "bargain hunter," as I'll discuss in a minute. That's also why they use things up, wear things out, make things last, and, sometimes, simply do without. For the cheapskate next door, it's really more about stretching their time than it is about stretching their dollars.<br><br>3. A Cheapskate Values Value<br><br>"Frank's the kind of guy who knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing."<br><br>My friend Carol Martina has a knack for zingers, many of them directed toward Frank, her husband of forty years and a retired U.S. government accountant. "Frank's so tight, he squeaks when he walks. When he opens up his wallet, Washington and Lincoln squint from the shock of seeing daylight."<br><br>I like Carol and Frank a lot. While Frank may indeed be tight with a buck, if Carol is correct about him "knowing the price of everything but the value of nothing," then he really doesn't fit the profile of the typical cheapskate next door. Sorry, Frank. But keep trying.<br><br>In response to the questions I asked about which factors influence cheapskates most when they consider whether or not to buy a product, surprisingly "price" was not the top choice. "Quality/durability" was ranked as the number-one consideration, with about 95 percent of cheapskates ranking "quality/durability" and "price" as the top two considerations, in many cases ranking them both as equally important. As Warren Buffet once said, "Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down."<br><br>Coming in third was "something that will increase/maintain value," which I'll also discuss in a minute. Trailing far behind those top three were a variety of other factors, including a "healthy choice," "eco-friendly," "hand/locally made vs. mass produced," "country where made," and, in last place, "brand."<br><br>It's clear from the questionnaires and comments I received that for the cheapskate next door, "value" is defined as Durability/<br><br>Quality Divided by Price, or D4D (Durability for Dollars), as I sometimes call it. This is reflective of the cheapskate's desire to own things that are going to last a very long time, and that perform well over the long haul without requiring expensive repairs or becoming functionally obsolete.<br><br>On this point, some of the cheapskates I've met kind of freaked me out, in a Rain Man sort of way. It's like they had an amortization calculator implanted in their brains. Rob Crabtree, for example, could instantly tell you whether one item-from a new car to a new pair of underwear-was a better value than another, based on the price and projected lifespan of each.<br><br>"When you don't live in a throwaway world-or at least you've made your own little world where you don't throw things away-then you need to do the math and figure out how much something costs based on how long it's going to last, not based on how long you're going to keep it before you throw it away," Rob told me.<br><br>(Hint from Rob "Rain Man" Crabtree: Go with boxers, even if they cost up to 20 percent more than briefs. Gotta factor in the increased risk of premature elastic failure with briefs, don't you know.)<br><br>4. Shopping Isn't a Cheapskate Sport<br><br>When people discover that I'm a cheapskate, I'm surprised at how often they say something like, "I just don't have all that time to shop for bargains." There's a common perception-a misperception, in my experience-that "cheapskate" is synonymous with "bargain hunter."<br><br>Don't get me wrong, we cheapskates like to get the best possible value for our money. So yeah, when we shop, we do our best to scope out bargains. But the difference between a cheapskate and a bargain hunter is that cheapskates generally don't like to shop. Cheapskates spend and consume less in large part because we take little or no joy in shopping-so we simply shop less-in contrast to most true bargain hunters I know.<br><br>Anecdotally, nearly all of the cheapskates I personally interviewed while writing this book made it clear that they don't view shopping as "recreation," "sport," or "therapy," as they often put it. That's not to say that they don't boast about what a good deal they got on this purchase, or how much they saved on that deal, because they frequently do (trust me). But in the case of the cheapskate next door, that's the result of being a smart but reluctant shopper, not a bargain hunter or hyper-consumer.<br><br>A number of studies and personal experiments over the years have supported the fact that the more time people spend shopping, the more they tend to buy and the more they tend to spend. As Gomer Pyle used to say, "Surprise, surprise, surprise."<br><br>As we'll see in Chapter 11, nearly 90 percent of the cheapskates I polled say they shop for groceries only once every week, if that often. That's in sharp contrast to the almost 50 percent of Americans who say they shop for groceries three or four times every week. And when asked how often they shop for clothing, a majority of cheapskates I polled responded twice per year or even less frequently.<br><br>Another rather surprising case in point: About 75 percent of those cheapskates polled say that they rarely or never shop at garage/yard sales, auctions, or rummage sales, often mentioning that such shopping venues encourage people to buy things they don't really need.<br><br>"I've never understood why people like to shop," cheapskate Janice Rogers told me. "To me it's a chore. Hell, I have more fun doing the laundry than going shopping. I guess [shopping's] like alcohol or drugs?. . . some people are addicted to it, and to other people it's nothing."<br><br>According to the cheapskate next door, the best way to win at the sport of shopping is to simply refuse to take the field.<br><br>5. A Cheapskate Regrets Nothing<br><br>I've been waiting on the World Health Organization to issue a Pandemic Alert. It's clear to me that here in America we're in the midst of an epidemic of buyer's remorse. Maybe it hasn't spread globally yet, so that's why the WHO is holding off on the alert.<br><br>I recently heard a report on the NBC Nightly News claiming that Americans express at least "some regrets" about 80 percent of the discretionary items they buy, within one year of having made the purchase. In fairness, that's not saying that they "entirely regret" the purchase or that they'd choose otherwise if they had it to do over again. And that's just their level of regret within the first year of purchasing an item; I assume that the ICKM4BT (I-Could-Kick-Myself-For- Buying-That) Level steadily increases with time.<br><br>While I continue to work tirelessly in the Ultimate Cheapskate Lab to develop a vaccine to prevent buyer's remorse, results may be many years away. But there's encouraging news for all those who suffer from ICKM4BT: I've discovered that the cheapskate next door is naturally immune. Some type of anti-buying antibody, I assume.<br><br>In response to the question "On a scale of one to ten, with one being never and ten being all of the time, how frequently do you buy an item that you eventually regret buying (aka 'buyer's remorse') or that disappoints you?," more than 90 percent of cheapskates responded "one" (never). A pretty stark contrast to the NBC News report, wouldn't you say?<br><br>Evelyn "Bible Babe" Edgett confessed that she's somewhat more susceptible to bu...</p><h2>The Complete Peanuts 1957-1958: Vol. 4 Paperback Edition</h2><p>In this fourth paperback volume, the 1950s close down and Peanuts enters its golden age. Linus, who had just learned to speak in the previous volume, becomes downright eloquent and even begins to fend off Lucy�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s bullying; even so, his neurosis becomes more pronounced, including a harrowing two-week �&#x20ac;&#x153;Lost Weekend�&#x20ac; sequence of blanketlessness. Charlie Brown cascades further down the hill to loserdom, with spectacularly lost kites, humiliating baseball losses (including one where he becomes �&#x20ac;&#x153;the Goat�&#x20ac; and is driven from the field in a chorus of BAAAAHs); at least his newly acquired �&#x20ac;&#x153;pencil pal�&#x20ac; affords him some comfort. But the rising star is undoubtedly Snoopy. He�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s at the center of the most graphically dynamic and action-packed episodes (the ones in which he attempts to grab Linus�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s blanket at a dead run), and even tentatively tries to sleep on the crest of his doghouse roof once or twice, with mixed results.</p><p>In the fourth volume in Fantagraphics Books' <i>Complete Peanuts</i> series, Snoopy continues to develop as a character, and the worm--Linus--turns against his fussbudget sister, Lucy. Sure, she's still a fierce intimidator of her little brother and Charlie Brown, but he's learned to strike back with a deft pair of pliers, a huge sand castle or snow dinosaur, or merely the will to walk up and change the channel. Lucy also continues her pursuit of the oblivious musician, Schroeder (contrary to the advice of Dear Agnes). Snoopy continues his impersonations (vulture, penguin, etc.), plays baseball and football, angsts over being called "fuzzy-face or "dime a dozen," and dances gleefully on Schroeder's piano. Charlie Brown, of course, has very little glee, especially when he has to manage a dysfunctional baseball team that only wins if he's sick or when the championship is riding on his catching a simple pop fly. But at least he has his pencil pal. Charles M. Schulz by this time was comfortably in his routine of multi-day stories, and there's a bit of foreshadowing when Schroeder, wildly inventing names of imaginary pianists, comes up with "Joseph Schlabotnik," which would later become the name of CB's baseball hero. The volume has an introduction by author Jonathan Franzen and a Sunday strip from May 3, 1953, which was discovered after the 1953-54 volume was printed. <i>--David Horiuchi</i><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><h2>Found</h2><p><p><b>An NPR Best Book * Winner of the SCIBA Book Award for Best Picture Book </b></p><p><b>Geisel Honor-winning author/illustrator Salina Yoon introduces adorable duo Bear and his bunny Floppy in </b><b><i>Found</i>--a charming picture book that </b><b>celebrates love and friendship in its many forms.</b></p><p>When Bear finds a lost stuffed toy bunny in the forest, he begins to worry.

Prim and Celia were sure Kate&#x2019;s restless unhappiness was due to disappointment. Prim assured her that Hugh would give in to their arguments and take her into town, but Kate no longer wanted to go. In the aftermath of her guardian&#x2019;s horrible disclosure, society parties had gone quite out of her head.<br><br>Kate couldn&#x2019;t bear for her little sister to find out that they weren&#x2019;t really family, so she said nothing about what she had learned, and she tried to keep up a cheerful appearance. But keeping a secret from loved ones is a heavy burden, and now she was keeping two secrets. Her nightmares were wearing her out, and her worried sister&#x2019;s constant questions were upsetting her. Prim noticed the pale cheeks and the dark shadows under her niece&#x2019;s eyes. Lips tight, she called the doctor, but neither he nor Prim could find anything wrong. Between them, they dosed Kate with a variety of strong and well-meaning remedies that did no good at all.<br><br>The weather changed with the approaching end of summer, and clouds gathered over the Hill. One breathless afternoon nothing could bring relief to spirit or body. A gray haze hung in the air, too diffuse to be called clouds, but too thick to be called anything else. The sun shone through it as a brilliant white spot, and not a whisper of wind stirred. As evening came, no thunder rumbled in the hills, and no breeze sprang up to fan their clammy cheeks. The sun was leaving without a blaze of color. The thick haze just seemed to swallow it.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, Aunt Prim, let us walk up in the hills and see if we can&#x2019;t find some cool wind somewhere,&#x201c; Kate begged. &#x201c;I promise we&#x2019;ll come back before it gets dark.&#x201d; Her aunt knew better than to let her go. Storms were sure to follow a day like this, even if they were taking their time building. But at last she gave consent, with all the conditions that approaching storms and nightfall demanded. They were to stay out of the woods, watch the sky, and come back at the first sign of bad weather.<br><br>The girls headed down through the orchard, intent on the rocky meadows beyond. Kate was sure that if they climbed to the top of one of those grassy hills, they were bound to find a breeze, but at the top of their meadow, they found no breath stirring. The twilight was blending with the strange, close sky to form a dark brown haze, and the grass at their feet shone with a blond shimmer, as if the few rays of light left could not rise above the surface of the ground. Landmarks even a few yards away were melting into the brown gloom. Purple lightning bloomed across the dark sky before them.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better go back,&#x201c; sighed Kate.<br><br>They waded through the grass back down the hillside. Ahead of them in the thick dusk stood the stone wall of the meadow, but no gate appeared as they followed the meadow&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait, Em, we must have gotten turned around. The gate&#x2019;s over there.&#x201d;<br><br>As their fence formed a corner with another stone fence, the gate appeared a few feet from them, white boards gleaming in the dim light. They hurried over to it as another shining purple curtain shook across the sky, and swinging the gate shut, they sped up the little road before them.<br><br>A couple of minutes later, they stopped short in bewilderment. Another stone fence blocked their path. But how was this possible? They should be at the orchard by now. The two girls climbed a slight rise and looked around in all directions, trying to make out the shapes of trees that marked the orchard. Some faint light still remained. They could see each other&#x2019;s faces, pale in the deep dusk, but now they couldn&#x2019;t distinguish the black horizon from the black cloudbanks. The lightning, undulating over the swollen masses of the clouds, was distant and too weak to see by. It gleamed silently first in front and then behind them.<br><br>&#x201c;This makes no sense,&#x201c; Kate said firmly, thinking over the way they had come. &#x201c;All we had to do was walk back down the hill, through the gate, and up the orchard path. We&#x2019;ve missed the gate somehow. There must be two in that meadow, and we hit on the other one. We&#x2019;ll follow the road back and look for the other gate out of that field, the one that takes us to the orchard.&#x201d;<br><br>With that plan in mind, they started off confidently, but now their light was gone. They found the little road again more by feel than by sight, but it didn&#x2019;t lead them to a gate. It turned and skirted along another stone wall, went through a tumbled-down gap, and lost itself altogether in a narrow draw.<br><br>Again and again, Kate tried desperately to find the right path in the darkness, making them s20retrace their steps, but each time they did, they lost their old landmarks. Everything seemed to shift in the darkness around them. They had no idea which direction they faced or where home was. They could only tell that they were moving farther and farther from the shelter of the woodlands. The fields were flattening out, and stone fences were becoming rare.<br><br>There followed a time which was the worst in their lives. Method was gone, and landmarks were forgotten. They blundered along hand in hand through the dense blackness, following any path they crossed. Lightning seemed to be all around them now, and every white flash lit up a dreary landscape that held no familiar sight. One black field followed another. They might be one mile from home, or they might be ten. They certainly felt that they had walked a hundred.<br><br>As they stumbled along, footsore and exhausted, Emily let out an excited squeak and tugged Kate around. Far across the fields, a light was shining. It wavered, winked out, and then showed up again. The girls turned and scrambled toward it.<br><br>The light was a bonfire, blazing up in the darkness with a reddish glow, and figures moved back and forth before it. The fire lit up no house or barn. It appeared to be built in the middle of an empty field. Kate began to watch the figures by the fire uneasily. A hunting party? Gypsies? Vagabonds? Two men stood by the fire in long cloaks, their hoods pulled down over their faces. That spoke perhaps of hunting and of the stormy weather. But two or three short people moved about as well. Children? They had to be, but there was something odd about their shapes. As the girls came nearer, Kate noticed four horses standing patiently beyond the fire. They appeared to be saddled. Hunting, then, but who would be out on such a night? She began to slow down, not so anxious to walk out of the darkness toward this strange group, but Emily, clutching Kate&#x2019;s hand, began to speed up. Warmth, light, people-these held no fears for her. She broke into a trot, pulling her sister behind her.<br><br>The party turned, sensing their approach. One of the short figures broke away from the fire-lit circle and bustled toward them.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, look! Two pretty girls right out of the storm! Do let old Agatha tell your fortune, dears.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gypsies!&#x201d; whispered Emily excitedly as Agatha hurried up. Kate stared down, astonished, at the shortest woman she had ever seen. Agatha came up only a little past Kate&#x2019;s waist, but her small, stocky body did not appear to be hunched or twisted. The old face was seamed into countless wrinkles, and the black eyes snapped and sparkled in the firelight. &#x201c;Here,&#x201c; she said, capturing Kate&#x2019;s hand in her own surprisingly large one, &#x201c;come by the fire so I can see your pretty face.&#x201d;<br><br>As Kate followed Agatha over to the bonfire, she glanced around nervously at the other members of the party. The two men stood nearby. One was only a little taller than she, thick and barrel-chested. The other man, of average height, towered over him. Perhaps they had been conversing before, but now they were silent, watching Agatha and the two girls. They were draped in the black cloaks and hoods she had noticed earlier, and she could see nothing at all of their faces. This was prudent, given the coming storm, but it irked Kate to be seen and not to see. She wished she had a cloak of her own.<br><br>Agatha, meanwhile, was peering intently at Kate&#x2019;s palm, turning it this way and that in the firelight. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201c; she breathed. &#x201c;Not every young lady has a hand like this.&#x201d; Kate heard chuckles from the men. &#x201c;But, dear,&#x201c; she said, ignoring them, &#x201c;I see danger in this hand. Danger from someone very close to you.&#x201d; Now the men roared with laughter. &#x201c;Be quiet, the two of you!&#x201d; She whirled on them, still holding Kate fast. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very serious!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about me?&#x201d; demanded Emily eagerly, holding out her hand to the old woman. &#x201c;Do you see danger in my hand?&#x201d; Old Agatha took her small palm and turned it toward the fire.<br><br>&#x201c;And such a lively thing you are, my dear!&#x201d; she said to Emily. &#x201c;Still a long way from marriage, aren&#x2019;t you? Well, that can&#x2019;t be helped, and one does grow, you know.&#x201d; Emily giggled over this odd speech, but Kate frowned. Hugging her arms about her, she stepped back from the firelight and eyed the two men warily. Now they had turned away and were talking again in quiet tones. She couldn&#x2019;t seem to catch what they were saying. The taller one threw his head back and laughed at something the short one said. She noticed as he laughed that he carried one shoulder higher than the other.<br><br>&#x201c;Your palm speaks of tears early but laughter late,&#x201c; Agatha summed up grandly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s as good as a palm can say. You&#x2019;ve a lovely, open nature, child.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Kate, look!&#x201d; Emily called excitedly. Kate turned to see a huge black tomcat approaching the fire. It rubbed its head against Emily&#x2019;s knee, its velvet coat shining in the light. Kate felt as ...</p></p><h2>Yoga for Body, Breath, and Mind: A Guide to Personal Reintegration</h2><p>Here is a practical and accessible introduction to the full, multifaceted richness of the yoga tradition. While most yoga books focus only on poses, <i>Yoga for Body, Breath, and Mind </i> integrates the three fundamental elements of a complete yoga practice: <i>asanas </i>(poses), <i>pranayama</i> (breathing practices), and meditation. A. G. Mohan, an internationally respected teacher, also explains essential philosophical concepts and offers the yogic perspective on health and healing. With step-by-step instructions and abundant illustrations, <i>Yoga for Body, Breath, and Mind </i> is the type of comprehensive guide that will be of interest to every yoga practitioner. <br><br>The author explains that often when we feel stress or a sense that life has gotten out of control, it's not because of life events themselves, but because the state of our own mind has become chaotic and fragmented. When we are in a state of what he calls "personal integration," we are centered, contented, and able to see people and events in life as they truly are. In this state, people are most able to make decisions and take actions that are clear and positive. In <i>Yoga for Body, Breath, and Mind </i> Mohan provides a structured yoga program to help readers cultivate this state of balance and integration. The book also includes an introduction to the practice of yoga therapy.</p><p><br><b>A. G. Mohan</b>&nbsp;was a student of "the father of modern yoga," Yogacarya Sri T.

As a faith of the marginalized and persecuted, it gave oppressed men and women strength and the will to survive. With the exile of thousands of Cubans in the wake of Castro's revolution in 1959, Santer�a came to the United States, where it is gradually coming to be recognized as a legitimate faith tradition.<br><br> Apart from vague suspicions that Santer�a's rituals include animal sacrifice and notions that it is a &#x201c;syncretistic&#x201d; form of Catholicism, most people in America's cultural and religious mainstream know very little about this rich faith tradition &#x2015; in fact, many have never heard of it at all. De La Torre, who was reared in Santer�a, sets out in this book to provide a basic understanding of its inner workings. He clearly explains the particular worldview, myths, rituals, and practices of Santer�a, and he discusses what role the religion typically plays in the life of its practitioners as well as the cultural influence it continues to exert in Latin American communities today.<br><br> In offering a balanced, informed survey of Santer�a from his unique &#x201c;insider-outsider&#x201d; perspective, De La Torre also provides insight into how Christianity and Santer�a can enter into dialogue &#x2015; a dialogue that will challenge Christians to consider what this emerging faith tradition can teach them about their own. Enhanced with illustrations, tables, and a glossary, De La Torre's Santer�a sheds light on a religion all too often shrouded in mystery and misunderstanding.</p><p>Miguel A. De La Torre is assistant professor of religion at Hope College, Holland, Michigan.<b>ForeWord Magazine Book of the Year Awards</b>,&nbsp;<i>Finalist, Religion</i>&nbsp;(2004)<br><b>Choice Magazine</b>,&nbsp;<i>Outstanding Academic Book</i>&nbsp;(2005)<br><br><b><i>South Florida Sun-Sentinel</i></b><br> "The author, who grew up in the Santeria faith, provides insight into the myths, rituals, worldview, history and cultural influence of the Afro-Cuban religion. Neither condemning nor condoning, he seeks to provide the information and context necessary to prompt discussion and understanding between Santeria believers and Christians."<br><br><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br> "Writing as both an academic outsider and a privileged former insider, De La Torre retells Yoruba myths clearly and expressively, and his analysis of religious syncretism is both scholarly and accessible. Detailed descriptions of the various manifestations of each&nbsp;<i>orisha</i>&nbsp;make this one of the most comprehensive books on the subject, while the complex issue of Santeria ritual, which can include animal sacrifice, is handled unsensationally but vividly. This book should be part of any collection intended to represent the breadth of American religious experience."<br><br><b>Anthony M. Stevens-Arroyo</b><br> "Miguel De La Torre has performed the almost magical academic feat of balancing the objectivity of a trained observer with the insights of an insider. He leads his readers on a historical, theological, and cultural journey that goes to the heart of this rich religious tradition unfolding within a rapidly changing American society."<br><br><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br> "De La Torre succeeds fully in giving us the best general introduction to Santer�a, an Afro-Cuban folk religion brought to the United States by Cuban refugees after Castro's 1959 revolution. . .

The headlines: orphaned as a child, Duchess in her own right, Queen of France, crusader, survivor of a terrible battle, kidnapped by her own husband, kidnapped by pirates, divorced for barrenness, Countess of Anjou, Queen of England, mother of at least five sons and five daughters, rebel against her own husband, prisoner for 15 years, ruler of England in her own right, traveler across the Pyrenees and Alps in winter in her seventies, and mentor to the most remarkable Queen medieval France was to know (her own granddaughter, obviously). Eleanor of Aquitaine&#x2019;s life has also been subjected to successive reinventions over the years, with the facts often losing the battle with speculation and wishful thinking. In this biography Sara Cockerill has gone back to the primary sources, and the wealth of recent first rate scholarship, and assessed which of the claims about Eleanor can be sustained on the evidence. The result is a complete re-evaluation of this remarkable woman&#x2019;s even more remarkable life. A number of often repeated myths are debunked and a fresh version of Eleanor emerges. In addition Sara Cockerill has added her own research, breaking new ground on Eleanor&#x2019;s relationship with the Church, her supposed antipathy to Thomas Becket and her relationships with all of her children, including her family by her first marriage.</p><p><b>Sara Cockerill</b> is the author of<i> Eleanor of Castile: The Shadow Queen</i>.&nbsp;Impeccably researched and beautifully written, this book offers a fresh perspective on one of the most controversial queens in history.

Before 1966, China was a typical communist state, with a command economy and a powerful party able to keep the population under control. But during the Cultural Revolution, in a move unprecedented in any communist country, Mao unleashed the Red Guards against the party. Tens of thousands of officials were humiliated, tortured, and even killed. Order had to be restored by the military, whose methods were often equally brutal. </p><p>In a masterly book, Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals explain why Mao launched the Cultural Revolution, and show his Machiavellian role in masterminding it (which Chinese publications conceal). In often horrifying detail, they document the Hobbesian state that ensued. The movement veered out of control and terror paralyzed the country. Power struggles raged among Lin Biao, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Qing&#x2015;Mao&#x2019;s wife and leader of the Gang of Four&#x2015;while Mao often played one against the other.</p><p>After Mao&#x2019;s death, in reaction to the killing and the chaos, Deng Xiaoping led China into a reform era in which capitalism flourishes and the party has lost its former authority. In its invaluable critical analysis of Chairman Mao and its brilliant portrait of a culture in turmoil, <i>Mao&#x2019;s Last Revolution</i> offers the most authoritative and compelling account to date of this seminal event in the history of China.</p></p><p><p>Roderick MacFarquhar was Leroy B. Williams Professor of History and Political Science, and Professor of Government, Harvard University.</p><p>Michael Schoenhals is Professor of Chinese at Chinese Lund University, Sweden.</p>It has been enthralling to read Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals's exhaustively researched new book on China's Cultural Revolution -- a sensation akin to returning to a Chinese painting in which a mist-shrouded landscape has miraculously cleared to reveal what was obscured beyond. While it was not difficult to feel the tension, even the fear, aloft in the land when I reported from Mao Zedong's China for the New Yorker during the mid-1970s, being there gave few intimations of the dark complexity of the political struggle playing out beneath the surface. By making sense out of this opaque decade, MacFarquhar (who teaches at Harvard University) and Schoenhals (who teaches at Lund University in Sweden) have provided the most definitive roadmap to date of China's odyssey through those tumultuous times.<p>But what happened is still not easy to explain completely. For complex reasons that involved Mao's political beliefs as well as his own psychological pathologies, the communist leader felt compelled to goad China into an extended paroxysm of revolutionary madness that ran from 1966 to 1976. Both to protect his own political supremacy and to wrench China out of its "feudal" past, he made politics and "class struggle" the currency of his revolutionary realm. In his own words, he created "great disorder under heaven." Proclaiming that "to rebel is justified," he called on students to "bombard the headquarters" of the Communist Party and thus set in motion one of the most unprecedented upheavals of the 20th century.</p><p>"You ask us how to do it," President Liu Shaoqi, who later died as a political enemy in one of Mao's prisons, told students as the leftist surge gathered momentum. "I tell you honestly, I don't know either. We're mainly going to be relying on you to make this revolution." </p><p>In the name of wiping out "capitalist roaders" (a euphemism for anyone seemingly opposed to Mao's revolutionary line) and "bourgeois revisionism," tens of millions of innocent victims were persecuted, professionally ruined, mentally deranged, physically maimed and even killed. "Beat to a pulp any and all persons who go against Mao Zedong Thought -- no matter who they are, what banner they fly, or how exalted their positions may be," proclaimed one Red Guard poster. </p><p>"Whereas party violence had normally been carefully controlled and calibrated, now the rules had been suspended," note the authors. "Freed from parental and societal constraints, youths, both girls and boys, had been unleashed to perpetrate assault, battery, and murder upon their fellow citizens to the extent their barely formed consciences permitted. The result was the juvenile state of nature, nationwide, foreshadowed in microcosm by Nobel Prize-winner William Golding in Lord of the Flies." </p><p>A few of China's more pragmatic leaders did shrink from Mao's cataclysmic vision of revolutionary extremism. But Mao's Last Revolution suggests how easy it can be for a mercurial "Big Leader," operating within a totalitarian system, to throw doubters so far off balance that none was able to organize resistance. And if there is one thing that Marxist-Leninist states do well, it is defoliating the political landscape of checks and balances, as well as watchdog institutions like the press. This is especially true when the media fall into the hands of one faction so that any sense of the actual variety of contending viewpoints is eclipsed, making it impossible for an outsider to discern how different factions were actually struggling against each other behind the scenes.</p><p>Mao was a master of keeping all comers in a state of paralyzing uncertainty. He garnered enormous power from his imperial opaqueness: While almost everyone wished "to work toward" Mao and his policies in order to please him, they could never be quite sure whether they were measuring up. Mao was the embodiment par excellence of the advice implicitly given by the Grand Inquisitor in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov when he chastises Jesus for failing to compel belief by ruling by "miracle, mystery and authority." </p><p>By frequently absenting himself from the everyday sordidness of Beijing politics, Mao conjured up an almost otherworldly authority. And by making conflicting pronouncements that were impossible to factor together, he maintained both deniability and an ambiguity that kept his subordinates "transfixed like rabbits in front of a cobra," as the authors put it. </p><p>In the end, after years of chaos, even Mao seemed to realize that the party's ability to continue leading China hung in the balance. He then called back cashiered veteran army leaders such as Deng Xiaoping. Curiously, although most of them had been persecuted by Mao, when it came to evaluating his life after his death, they still gave Mao a pass, finding only 30 percent of his policies erroneous and 70 percent correct. But as Deng pragmatically observed, discrediting Mao "would mean discrediting our Party and state." And so, in the end, Mao's legacy as grand progenitor of the Chinese Communist Revolution was left largely intact, despite the horrors of this last revolutionary paroxysm.</p><p>MacFarquhar and Schoenhals have drawn from a truly impressive array of materials, including documents, wall posters, autobiographies, journalistic reports, interviews, speeches, academic studies and personal reminiscences. But here a cautionary word is in order. The field is awash with "wild" (rather than "official") histories and sources, which include autobiographies, memoirs, reminiscences and reflections filled with recovered memories and reconstructed dialogue of questionable provenance and accuracy. But the sources for this impressive book are more solid and varied than for any previous effort. One can only lament that Mao's Last Revolution will not be available in China, where the party's aversion to probing into such sensitive topics makes it unlikely that a similar historical research project will be forthcoming anytime soon. </p><p>China has come a long way since Mao. But neither he nor his revolution has been completely interred; his body still lies on public view in Tiananmen Square, his image remains on China's money, and his portrait still hangs on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. With China's political system still lacking the kinds of checks and balances that can bring a society back from the brink of extremism, optimism about its political future should be tempered by realism.</p><p>Indeed, this September, on the 30th anniversary of both Mao's death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the party still chose to spend a week celebrating his legacy, culminating with an official concert in the Great Hall of the People entitled "The Sun is the reddest and Chairman Mao is the most beloved." No mention was made of the incalculable damage his Cultural Revolution inflicted on his country. In the future, one important index of China's passage toward political maturity will be the degree to which it feels able to repudiate both Mao and his Cultural Revolution legacy. </p><p>Reviewed by Orville Schell <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

His vast building program aimed to modernize urban infrastructure, expand the public realm with extensive recreational facilities, remove blight, and make the city more livable for the middle class. This book offers a fresh look at the physical transformation of New York during Moses&#x2019;s nearly forty-year reign over city building from 1934 to 1968.<br><br> It is hard to imagine that anyone will ever have the same impact on New York as did Robert Moses. In his various roles in city and state government, he reshaped the fabric of the city, and his legacy continues to touch the lives of all New Yorkers. Revered for most of his life, he is now one of the most controversial figures in the city&#x2019;s history. <em>Robert Moses and the Modern City</em> is the first major publication devoted to him since Robert Caro&#x2019;s damning 1974 biography, <em>The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York</em>.<br><br> In these pages eight short essays by leading scholars of urban history provide a revised perspective; stunning new photographs offer the first visual record of Moses&#x2019;s far-reaching building program as it stands today; and a comprehensive catalog of his works is illustrated with a wealth of archival records: photographs of buildings, neighborhoods, and landscapes, of parks, pools, and playgrounds, of demolished neighborhoods and replacement housing and urban renewal projects, of bridges and highways; renderings of rejected designs and controversial projects that were defeated; and views of spectacular models that have not been seen since Moses made them for promotional purposes.<em>Robert Moses and the Modern City</em> captures research undertaken in the last three decades and will stimulate a new round of debate.<br><br><em>Robert Moses and the Modern City</em> captures research undertaken in the last three decades and will stimulate a new round of debate.</p><p><p><strong>Hilary Ballon</strong> is an architectural historian and professor at Columbia University.

Hays Town</h2><p><p>A. Hays Town changed the face of the Louisiana house. In a career that includes designing more than five hundred homes, he led architects, builders, and homeowners to embrace the finest elements of Louisiana's architectural past. Almost every home built in Louisiana during the last twenty years is in some way inspired by Town's work.<br>The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town honors his legacy as Louisiana's premier residential architect. Color photographs of numerous homes -- including Town's own -- by Philip Gould combined with an illuminating text by Cyril E. Vetter produce a volume that captures the appeal and beauty of the state's finest architectural tradition.<br>Born and raised in rural southwest Louisiana, Hays Town graduated from Tulane University with a degree in architecture in 1926 and worked for a firm in Jackson, Mississippi, for many years. He established his own successful commercial practice in Baton Rouge in 1939, but in the 1960s, Town turned to his abiding passion -- residential architecture. Throughout this chapter of his career, he perfected his inimitable style and emerged as one of the most prominent architects in the South.<br>Town's residential designs are perceptibly influenced by the diverse culture of south Louisiana. His synthesis of the classic Acadian cottage, Spanish courtyards, and exterior French doors with Creole-influenced full-length shutters achieves an original confluence of seemingly disparate yet elegantly balanced themes and forms. Other Town trademarks include pigeonniers, tree alleys, thirteen-foot ceilings, heavy use of such woods as cypress and heart of pine, plantation-style separate structures, and brick floors with a special beeswax finish.<br>The Louisiana Houses of A. Hays Town illuminates the momentous effect Town has had on the look of Louisiana. Crafted from the perspective of two people, Vetter and Gould, who are not architects but admirers of one man's exceptional talent, this delightful book demonstrates that each Town house is a work of art that fits both person and terrain. At the door of each home, proud owners hang a bronze plaque that says it all: A. Hays Town, Architect.</p></p><p><p>Over a twenty-year career in the communications industry, Cyril E.

Garvey imparts in the generous accompanying text here, Link worked in ways then as rare as steam locomotives--with large, tripod-mounted view cameras and, because he preferred working at night when he could exert more control over lighting, he used scores of flashbulbs that were set off precisely at the time calculated to allow for a particular exposure. One album of those night images, <i>Steam, Steel &amp; Stars</i> (1987), has appeared, and more of them are here, along with many daytime views and a little sampling of the few color pictures he made (including the only two color shots taken at night). Technical marvels, they are also aesthetic miracles, charged with human feeling because Link cared for the communities that lived along the NW and for the railroad's employees more than for its gigantic machinery and buildings and because he is a master of natural-looking dramatic lighting. His pictures are as lyrical as they are powerful, as numinous as they are romantically materialist: masterpieces. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</h2><p>Book by Wollstonecraft, Mary</p><p>In this passionate reaction to Rousseau&#39;s pedagogical work Emile (1762) Wollstonecraft powerfully defends woman&#39;s ability to reason, given appropriate education. Her radical prescription was for girls to be educated alongside boys and to the same standard. Originally published in 1792, this is a foundational work of feminist political thought.Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>Beyond the Third Dimension: Geometry, Computer Graphics, and Higher Dimensions (Scientific American Library)</h2><p>Looks at how mathematicians, scientists, philosophers, artists, and computers have explored higher dimensions</p><p></p><h2>Many Beautiful Things: Stories and Recipes from Polizzi Generosa</h2><p>Vincent Schiavelli is known to most of us as a character actor who has appeared in such films as Ghost, Man on the Moon, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest. Schiavelli grew up in Brooklyn, speaking both Sicilian and English at home. Some of his earliest memories are of sitting at the kitchen table while his grandparents told stories of the life and the people they had left behind in Polizzi Generosa, a small city in the Madonie Mountains of Sicily. As Schiavelli grew older, those stories, and the city about which they were told, took on a mythic quality. When he was nearly forty he made his first trip there, and what he found was more extraordinary than the &#34;once upon a time&#34; fables of his childhood. In Many Beautiful Things, Schiavelli invites readers to join him in discovering the people, culture, and food of the city that has, in essence, become his second home. Equal parts memoir and cookbook, it is the best of both. Schiavelli is an accomplished and elegant writer who evokes a foreign and often closed culture from a unique perspective: an outsider fluent in the language with still-strong familial ties. The recipes -- which reflect the ancient influences of Greece, North Africa, and Spain -- are simple, rustic, and delicious, depending on local products and seasonal bounty. This is not your usual Southern Italian fare but a unique regional cuisine: Pumpkin Caponata, Ditali with Drowned Lettuce, Fried Ricotta Omelet, Potato Gratin with Bay Leaves, Almond Love Bites, Veal Shoulder Roasted with Marsala, and Baked Pasta with Almonds (rigatoni baked in a pork rag� with chopped toasted almonds) are just a few of the extraordinary dishes you&#39;ll find in this book, all of which can be reproduced by cooks with delectable results. Schiavelli provides a comprehensive list of mail-order sources. And if you want to visit Polizzi Generosa, there&#39;s a guide on how to get there, where to stay, and where to eat. Illustrated with black-and-white line drawings by Polizzi&#39;s best known artist, Santo Lipani (who also happens to be an extraordinary cook), Many Beautiful Things is a feast, both culinary and literary.</p><p>As a popular character actor, Vincent Schiavelli's face is easily recognizable. But you'll look at this actor--and serious cook--in a new light once you lose yourself in <i>Many Beautiful Things</i>, a compilation of personal stories, with more than 75 recipes, about his visits to a small hilltop town in Sicily called Polizzi Generosa, the birthplace of his grandparents. Schiavelli is embraced as a long-lost by the Polizzani, and they readily share their local legends, town gossip, and the trials and tribulations of living in a place far removed from the rest of Italy. As a result, when he introduces us to the quirky characters who populate the village he does it with a rare sensitivity, and real respect. You'll cry for Turiddu Lavanca, the lovesick forager; laugh with Za Momo, a friend's grandmother; and wish you could taste something, anything, made by Pino Agliata, Schiavelli's favorite pastry chef.<p>In Polizzi, life revolves around the table, and as Schiavelli tells us, "culinary expertise is divided into ... those who cook and eat, and those who don't cook but still eat heartily." As Schiavelli weaves his tales, slipping in mouth-watering descriptions of dishes like Potato Gratin with Bay Leaves, Zucchini Flowers Stuffed with Bechamel, and Pumpkin Caponata, and sweets such as Almond Love Bites and Almond Nougat, you'll find yourself skipping to the end of each chapter to make sure the recipes are there. Take this book to read on vacation, and then find a place for it in your kitchen. <i>--Leora Y.

Drawing from recent and ongoing research in the field, gender scholar Amy Wharton develops and expands upon theoretical approaches to gender from her acclaimed first edition. These approaches emphasize how gender can be viewed through different "lenses," and how each one generates a particular way of thinking about gender and its role in social life.<br> <br> <p>Wharton shows how individualist approaches view gender as part of the person; interactional approaches focus on the ways that gender emerges through social interaction; and institutional views emphasize how gender is built into organizations, social structures, and institutional arrangements. The book deftly summarizes and examines these three frameworks to facilitate an understanding of gender's contested meanings and vast areas of research. Also addressed is the importance of analyzing gender in relation to other kinds of distinctions, such as those based on race, social class, or sexual orientation. The newest research findings by key scholars are also discussed, and the inclusion of cross-national studies allow for comparative analysis of different areas of study. <i>The Sociology of Gender: An Introduction to Theory and Research,</i> Second Edition<i>,</i> offers the most up-to-date and accessible overview of this prominent subfield of sociological enquiry available today.</p><b>Amy S.

Dwan is one of the most influential figures in the history of twentieth-century American art. Her eponymously named galleries, the first established in a Los Angeles storefront in 1959, followed by a second in New York in 1965, became a beacon for influential postwar American and European artists. She sponsored the debut show for Yves Klein in the United States, and she championed such artists as Franz Kline, Robert Rauschenberg, Claes Oldenburg, Sol LeWitt, and Ad Reinhardt. Her Los Angeles gallery featured abstract expressionism, neo-Dada, and pop, while the New York branch became associated with the emerging movements of minimalism and conceptualism. At the same time, the gallery&#x2019;s influence expanded to remote locations in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, where Dwan sponsored such iconic earthworks as Robert Smithson&#x2019;s <i>Spiral Jetty</i>, Michael Heizer&#x2019;s <i>Double Negative</i>, and Walter De Maria&#x2019;s <i>Lightning Field</i>. Though Dwan was a major force in the art world of the sixties and seventies, her story and the history of her gallery have been largely unexplored&#x2014;until now.<br><br> Alongside lush full-color images of one hundred leading artworks, the book deepens our understanding of the artistic exchanges Dwan facilitated during this age of mobility, when air travel and the interstate highway system linked the two coasts and transformed the making of art and the sites of its exhibition. James Meyer, the curator of the exhibition and the foremost authority on minimal art, contributes an essay that is a sophisticated and broad-ranging analysis of Dwan&#x2019;s legacy.<br><br> Honoring Dwan&#x2019;s significant influence and impact on postwar art, <i>Dwan Gallery </i>is a rich and informative collection that will be treasured by fans of contemporary art.</p><p><b>James Meyer</b> is&nbsp;Curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. &nbsp;He was previously Winship Distinguished Research Associate Professor of Art History at Emory University and Deputy Director and Chief Curator of Dia Art Foundation.

Each volume contains the basic information useful to bolting experts in any industry, but because the two volumes are more clearly focused, they are easier and more efficient to use. The first volume, Non-Gasketed Joints, describes the design, behavior, misbehavior, failure modes, and analysis of the bolts and bolted joints that play a large, even ubiquitous, role in the myriad machines and structures that form our world. <br><br>The author elucidates why proper bolt tension - often called preload - is critical to the safety and reliability of an assembled joint. He introduces many ways to create that preload as well as ways to measure or inspect for it, then covers how to design joints that are less apt to misbehave or fail, using the guidelines, procedures, and simple algebraic mathematics included in the text. The book provides numerous tables, charts, graphs, and appendices, giving you all the information and data required to design and use non-gasketed bolted joints.

Anthropologist Jo�o Biehl leads a detective-like journey to know Catarina; to unravel the cryptic, poetic words that are part of the dictionary&#x201d; she is compiling; and to trace the complex network of family, medicine, state, and economy in which her abandonment and pathology took form.<br><br>As Biehl painstakingly relates Catarina&#x2019;s words to a vanished world and elucidates her condition, we learn of subjectivities unmade and remade under economic pressures, pharmaceuticals as moral technologies, a public common sense that lets the unsound and unproductive die, and anthropology&#x2019;s unique power to work through these juxtaposed fields. <i>Vita&#x2019;s</i> methodological innovations, bold fieldwork, and rigorous social theory make it an essential reading for anyone who is grappling with how to understand the conditions of life, thought and ethics in the contemporary world.</p><p>"Jo�o Biehl's <i>Vita</i> is a greatly arresting work.

Most people lived in the countryside, and just half survived until their late twenties. By the beginning of our own century, unified Germany was the most powerful state in Europe. No longer a provincial "land of poets and thinkers," the country had been transformed into an industrial and military giant with an advanced welfare system.<br> <em>The Long Nineteenth Century: A History of Germany, 1780-1918,</em> is a masterful account of this transformation. Spanning 150 years, from the eve of the French Revolution to the end of World War I, it introduces students to crucial areas of German social and cultural history -- demography and social structure, work and leisure, education and religion -- while providing a comprehensive account of political events. The text explains how Germany came to be unified, and the consequences of that unification. It describes the growing role of the state and new ways in which rulers asserted their authority, but questions clich�s about German "obedience." It also looks at the ways in which the factory, the railway, and the movement into towns created new social relations and altered perceptions of time and place. Drawing on a generation of work devoted to migration, housing, crime, medicine, and popular culture, Blackbourn offers a powerful and original account of a changing society, trying to do justice to the experiences of contemporary Germans, both women and men. Informed by the latest scholarship, <em>The Long Nineteenth Century: A History of Germany, 1780-1918,</em> provides a complete and up-to-date alternative to conventional political histories of this period and is essential reading for undergraduates in German history and political science courses.</p><p>Many European historians consider the 19th century, at least on their continent, to have lasted over a hundred years, getting a head start on the calendar with the French Revolution of 1789 and extending until the onset of World War I in 1914 (when the "short 20th century" began). During this period, writes David Blackbourn in this fine, compact history, Germany evolved from a confused patchwork of municipalities and principalities with several layers of rulers (one village of 50 families, he notes, answered to four lords) into the most powerful unified nation in Europe.<p> Blackbourn examines the rise of the idea of "Germanness," the development of presumed national traits such as obedience and antimodernism, and the growth of the bureaucratic state, which favored a kind of corporatism that clashed with trade and agrarian associations and paved the way for the class conflict Karl Marx would analyze--as well as what Blackbourn calls "a strong sense of suffocation." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>David Blackbourn is Coolidge Professor of History and Director of Graduate Studies in History at Harvard University.</p><h2>Cornelius Nepos: On Great Generals. On Historians. (Loeb Classical Library No. 467)</h2><p>Cornelius Nepos was born in Cisalpine Gaul but lived in Rome and was a friend of Cicero, Atticus, and Catullus. Most of his writings, which included poems, moral examples from history, a chronological sketch of general history, a geographical work, Lives of Cato the Elder and Cicero, and other biographies, are lost. Extant is a portion of his &#39;De Viris Illustribus&#39;: (i) part of his parallel lives of Roman and non-Roman famous men, namely the portion containing lives of non-Roman generals (all Greeks except three) and a chapter on kings; and (ii) two lives from the class of historians. The lives are short popular biographies of various kinds, written in a usually plain readable style, of value today because of Nepos&#39;s use of many good sources.</p><p><p>John Carew Rolfe (1859&#x2013;1943) taught at Cornell, Harvard, and the Universities of Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p></p><h2>Adonis to Zorro: Oxford Dictionary of Reference and Allusion</h2><p>Allusions are a colorful extension to the English language, drawing on our collective knowledge of literature, mythology, and the Bible to give us a literary shorthand for describing people, places, and events. A cunning crook is an Artful Dodger, a daydreamer is like Billy Liar, a powerful woman is a modern-day Amazon - we can suffer like Sisyphus, fail like Canute, or linger like the smile of the Cheshire Cat. <br><br>This absorbing and accessible A-Z explains the meanings of allusions in modern English, from Adonis to Zorro, Tartarus to Tarzan, and Rubens to Rambo. Fascinating to browse, the book is based on an extensive reading program that has identified the most commonly-used allusions.

Will I have a long and healthy life? <p> Now the answers to these questions and more are literally at your fingertips. </p><p> Learning palmistry, the art of analyzing the shape of the palm and the lines on it, is easy with this revolutionary new system designed for beginners. Simply look up the theme you are interested in -- love and relationships, career, talents, health, money or children -- to find one or two hand lines to investigate. Then follow the color-coded drawings to locate the line on your palm and to learn what it means. For example, changes in your career are revealed by breaks in the Line of Fate (coded purple), and the course of a love affair can be forecast by the Line of Affection (coded green). Soon you'll even be interpreting the hands of your friends and family with confidence!</p></p><p><b>Roz Levine</b> has been a professional palmist and astrologer for twelve years. As a counselor involved in alternative therapies, she focuses on health matters and on encouraging the latent potential in each of her clients. She lives in Brighton, England.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>The Hand As A Canvas</b> </p><p> Your unique and individual character is mirrored on your hands. Imagine the hands as a canvas, the lines and features upon them as the paint that colours all the hues and tones of your personality and predispositions. The picture, however, is likely to change in time. </p><p> You can alter the lines upon your palm. With will and effort, you can be the designer and artist creating the picture of your own destiny. Your metaphorical box of paints is likely to include some colours you never thought of using before. If we link the idea of colour to ways of thinking and being, we may realize that we have so often been using greys and flat, dull tones, whilst forgetting to dip into the brighter, positive shades of hope and love. When these colours are unused, they become dry and cracked, but remain in your paintbox. So use them to colour your life in the best way you can. </p><p> The following pages will reveal how the i shape of the hands, fingers and the contours of the palm constitute the framework of your personality. </p><p> <b>The Language of Hands</b> </p><p> When you are trying to discover the personality of someone you have just met or do not know, how often do you find yourself looking at his or her hands? You may not even do this consciously, but the way in which people use their hands will be telling you much about the personality of the owners. </p><p> In many ways, the hands can reveal more about someone than the face, especially when it comes to first impressions. We can change our facial expressions, 'put on a brave face', smile with just our mouth but not with our eyes, etc. Make-up can make people look very different and many people succumb to the plastic surgeon's scalpel. Hands, however, have a language of their own that is less easy to manipulate. When people are carefully controlling their facial and verbal expressions, their hands are often telling quite a different story. Gesticulations can therefore be very revealing. Think of how the hands are used to demonstrate so many feelings: drumming fingers in impatience, making fists in anger and pointing the forefinger in aggression or accusation. Biting, picking or clicking the nails, cracking the knuckles and other fidgety habits usually suggest a nervous disposition or a habit stemming from childhood that is difficult to break. Effeminate men often affect a limp wrist and women tend to have looser and more flexible wrists than men. Look at the hands of tiny babies: even at this early stage in life, individual gesticulation patterns are established. </p><p> In business, we set great store by the handshake: if it is firm, we interpret it as a good, decisive sign, while a weak handshake is taken as an indication of a vacillating, unassertive nature. Remember, however, that a finn handshake can be faked. There are far more subtle ways to find out the way another person is thinking. Supposing you are discussing a business arrangement with someone and notice that the thumbs are held inwards, towards the palm. This suggests that the other person is not revealing feelings of annoyance and may also be secretive. A more positive sign is rubbing the fingertips together, especially those of the thumb and the little finger, which occurs when trying to generate the flow of ideas. Ring-twisting shows convoluted thinking. Placing the ring finger under the middle one can mean that financial issues are not being openly revealed. </p><p> Hand gestures are also used to insult others. In some countries it is rude to point the index and middle fingers up at someone, forming the 'V' sign. The origins of this insult are interesting. When the longbow was used in battles, these two fingers drew the bow, and soldiers had them cut off when they were taken prisoner. For this reason, the fingers were often pointed at the enemy in a victorious, jeering gesture. </p><p> The fingers rings are worn upon can also be revealing. In old paintings of important people, rings tend to be worn on the index finger, the finger of power and ambition. Gay people often adorn their little fingers with a ring. A ring chosen to fit the middle finger can link with a slight psychological quirk or problem. Making a fist is obviously aggressive and reveals tension. Rubbing hands together usually signals pleasant anticipation. As you can see, there are many ways in which our hands express what we think or feel. </p><p> <b>Open and Closed Hands</b> </p><p> When you look at hands placed upon a flat surface, it is interesting to note how the owner holds them. Some people naturally allow their fingers to splay open; this literally shows that the overall personality is also likely to be open and that the person is receptive to having his or her hands examined. If the fingers are naturally held close together, the opposite applies and the owner may not be as keen to be scrutinized. Open hands often have spaces between the fingers at their roots where they join onto the palm. You can see the spaces more easily if the fingers are held together and the hand is held up to the light. This means that the person not only has an open nature, but is also generous and friendly, often gregarious, sometimes a little vulnerable and will usually be open to new ideas and experiences. If the fingers bend back easily away from the palm under slight pressure, then the above attributes will be marked and there will also be adaptability. </p><p> If there are no spaces between the fingers, the owner may be rather good at holding on to what he or she has, in all senses. On the closed hand if the fingers do not yield to slight pressure when bent away from the palm, but naturally turn inwards towards the palm, it reveals a personality that is far less spontaneous, gregarious and willing to reach out for new experiences than the openhanded type. Inflexible fingers reveal a tendency to resist change: the owner will wish to hang on to things and people that are familiar, adhering to crystallized patterns of existence. Such a person will always need a certain amount of time to adjust to any new phase in life. </p><p> <b>Hand Size</b> </p><p> The size of the hands can also be extremely revealing. It does not necessarily follow that a large person will have big hands, or that a small person will have little ones. To judge whether hands are big or small, they must be considered in relation to overall body size. Big hands generally belong to people who are good at handling detailed and even intricate activities. A brain surgeon would be likely to have such hands. Small-handed people do not generally take to things that require detailed thought or intricate actions as they tend to apply themselves to matters in hand in a quick and sometimes more intuitive way. The natural impatience of people with small hands is exacerbated if the fingers are short. If the nails are naturally short as well, then the lack of patience could be a real problem. </p><p> Small hands often belong to people who are good at organizing and handling things on a large scale. Very dynamic, high achievers with the ability to direct others will usually have hands that are small in relation to their overall body size. Small hands tend to be warm to the touch, whilst long, big, bony hands are often cool. In some ways, this can be seen as a reflection of the two temperaments. Small, neat hands found on a person with a large, tall body can denote great dexterity in handling many activities and can create good co-ordination. </p><p> As a rule, owners of broad hands need a feeling of physical freedom and space (see The Outdoor Type, pages 62-63). Those with narrow palms, however, are usually happy with much more indoor, static lifestyles, and can be good at jobs that require a lot of desk work. </p><p> <b>The Right and Left hands</b> </p><p> Are you right-handed or left-handed? This is the first thing you need to ask when you examine someone's hands. The two hands have a different significance. Physically, they usually vary too, in the shape of the fingers and especially in the lines, although some people's right and left hands are virtually the same. </p><p> Always begin a reading by asking the person whose hands you are looking at whether he or she is right-handed or left-handed. Some people are ambidextrous in many ways, in which case it will be the hand used for writing that shall be regarded as the 'right 'hand. The 'left' hand shows the basic personality and predispositions as well as past and current events. The 'right' hand shows how the basic personality has changed or is likely to develop and indicates future events. When you are reading the hands of a left-handed person, you will regard the right hand as the basic one, reflecting the present and past events, and the left as the hand linked with the future. </p><p> The two hands illustrated (above) have very different fingers. The index finger is much shorter on the left hand than on the right. As this finger tells us a lot about a person's feelings of confidence and adequacy, this person would have suffered from a lack of confidence, especially early in life, but will grow into far more self-certainty. Note also that the left hand shows a small and weak-looking ring finger, whilst the right hand shows the finger as stronger, no longer rather dwarfed by the middle finger. The owner of such hands would have problems with being positive and discovering creative energies; but as time goes by these qualities will develop. </p><p> There are no hard-and-fast rules about how long our fingers should be as our hands are all unique. Usually, however, the index and ring fingers are about the same length, their tips ending halfway up the top section or phalange of the middle finger; the little finger should end at the crease of the ring finger's top phalange. As you read on, you will learn about the lines of the palm and their meanings and see just how different lines can be on each hand. Whenever there is a marked difference, you will know that the owner of the hands has changed, or will adapt, a great deal in the course of his or her lifetime. </p><p> <b>Significance of Shape</b> </p><p> There are six basic hand shapes and each reveals a great deal about the personality of the owner. It can be easy to assess the shape of the hands from a distance, so once you understand their meanings you will find yourself looking at the hands of people wherever you go. </p><p> The hand shapes explained here are archetypal, in that they are very defined types. As you look at more hands, you will find some that obviously belong to one category or another and others that are a mixture of shapes, such as a square palm with spatulate fingers. Sometimes fingers differ from each other on the same hand. If each finger is different, there will be great versatility, sometimes too much, rendering focus and defined direction difficult to achieve. </p><p> When you look at the shapes of hands and fingers, do take into account the age of the subject. Older peoples' hands often have distorted bones due to arthritic or rheumatic tendencies, which can become stiffer as the owner ages. </p><p> The philosophic hand is a slightly more unusual shape than the five other basic types. It is long, bony and angular with knotty fingers. People with such hands are often interested in religious, literary or occult matters, or other areas that benefit from serious or analytical thinking. They are difficult for others to understand and can be withdrawn. If the finger joints are very knotty, an aptitude for deep, analytical thought will be amplified. </p><p> The elementary hand often has few lines on its palm. When this is the case, the rather basic, instinctive nature will be even more simplistic. Pointed and conic hands often have many lines upon them, but if they do not, then the nervous tendencies associated with these hands shall be more earthed and the owner will be able to handle life more calmly. Square hands can benefit from a rather lined palm, in that the need for conformity is given some leeway and freedom. The owner of a very lined spatulate hand can be over-active and find relaxation difficult. </p><p> <b>Reading the fFingers</b> </p><p> In palmistry, each finger has its own characteristic, which can be very revealing about personality. Each finger is named after a planet. The illustration (below left) shows the relevant planetary symbol on each finger. The first, or index finger, is called Jupiter. It is associated with self-confidence, ambition, a positive attitude to life and sometimes with religion. The second, or middle finger, is called Saturn and is the finger of responsibility, seriousness and balance. It serves as a dividing line between our external personality and our inner world. The ring, or third finger is called the Sun and corresponds with our creative feelings and urges, though not necessarily in the artistic sense. This finger can also reveal one's capacity for happiness. The little finger is called Mercury. It is linked to mental ability and communicative skills and, to some extent, attitudes towards sexual matters. </p><p> <b>Finger Types</b> </p><p> There are four main finger shapes or types of finger. Square fingers reveal a practical, conventional, sensible and well-organized disposition. If the fingertips are uniformly square, there will be a strong sense of order, a realistic approach to life and a love of punctuality. </p><p> People with pointed fingers are extremely sensitive, often quite impractical and can be rather difficult for more realistic and worldly types to understand. If all the fingers are pointed and their tips are long, there will be a dreamy, unrealistic and often over-idealistic attitude. Beauty will be important and reality will often be difficult to come to terms with. </p><p> Conic, or round fingers, belong to quick, intuitive people. Such types can be impressionable and therefore vulnerable. Sympathetic, spontaneous and easily moved, conic-fingered folk can sometimes be inconsistent in their emotional responses to others. </p><p> Spatulate fingers belong to active, original, energetic people who possess enterprise and a sense of adventure. The enthusiasm generated by a person with spatulate fingers can affect other people positively. </p><p> <b>Thumbs</b> </p><p> There are two main types of thumb: the supple-jointed and the firm-jointed. The more supple the thumb, the easier it will bend outwards and backwards away from the hand. When supple and flexible it donates a person with a flexible disposition and a broad mind who can sometimes be unconventional. This person will tend not to be too opinionated and will therefore be receptive to new ideas. The owner of such will hate discord and always try to avoid aggressive situations. There can be a generous nature, exhibited not only in material ways, but also in a generosity of spirit. Humanitarian attitudes can be another attribute of the flexible-thumbed type, as can frankness and honesty. If the thumb is very flexible, an impulsive response to life is likely. The only negative aspect of this type of personality is that there can also be a tendency to promise more than can be delivered in an effort to please others, which may need to be held in check sometimes to avoid disappointing people and appearing unreliable. </p><p> The stiff, firm thumb shows a resistant character: the less it yields and bends backwards...</p></p><h2>The Elephant in the Boardroom: Speaking the Unspoken about Pastoral Transitions</h2><p>Carolyn Weese and J.

It is not designed to be the definitive volume on storytelling; rather, it is a selective work that reflects the knowledge and interests of the writer, editors, and consultants who contributed to the book. Its aim is to give a balanced and interesting treatment of the subject, concerning itself with "historic, cultural, and multiethnic approaches to oral literature around the world."<p>Part 1 consists of four essays that discuss the development and cultural meaning of storytelling. Part 2, the main body of the encyclopedia, has more than 700 alphabetically arranged entries, beginning with<i> Aardeme, Verna, </i>compiler and writer of African and African American folktales, and ending with <i>Zoroastrian Creation</i>. Entries are not signed, though the names of contributors appear near the beginning of the volume. The entries include individuals connected with folklore and storytelling, such as Joseph Campbell and Zora Neale Hurston; characters from folklore and mythology; kinds of folklore, motifs, ethnic storytelling; and places. There are also entries for some titles, such as <i>Mahabharata </i>and <i>Thousand and One Nights. </i>The scope covers the ancient and the modern, familiar and less-known names and characters, variants of tales and ethnic groups of all kinds. Longer entries, such as <i>Near and Middle Eastern Storytelling </i>and <i>Robin Hood, </i>can be more than two pages in length. A very modern touch is entries such as <i>Rap Song </i>and <i>Rock Song, </i>discussing the folkloric elements of these musical genres.</p><p>Extensive cross-references are used. Capitalized words and terms used within the articles indicate a full entry can be found. Many entries include lists of a few titles for further reading.

The science says yes. <i>In How to Clone a Mammoth</i>, Beth Shapiro, evolutionary biologist and pioneer in "ancient DNA" research, walks readers through the astonishing and controversial process of de-extinction. From deciding which species should be restored, to sequencing their genomes, to anticipating how revived populations might be overseen in the wild, Shapiro vividly explores the extraordinary cutting-edge science that is being used&#x2015;today&#x2015;to resurrect the past. Journeying to far-flung Siberian locales in search of ice age bones and delving into her own research&#x2015;as well as those of fellow experts such as Svante Paabo, George Church, and Craig Venter&#x2015;Shapiro considers de-extinction's practical benefits and ethical challenges. Would de-extinction change the way we live? Is this really cloning? What are the costs and risks? And what is the ultimate goal?</p><p>Using DNA collected from remains as a genetic blueprint, scientists aim to engineer extinct traits--traits that evolved by natural selection over thousands of years&#x2015;into living organisms. But rather than viewing de-extinction as a way to restore one particular species, Shapiro argues that the overarching goal should be the revitalization and stabilization of contemporary ecosystems. For example, elephants with genes modified to express mammoth traits could expand into the Arctic, re-establishing lost productivity to the tundra ecosystem.</p><p>Looking at the very real and compelling science behind an idea once seen as science fiction, <i>How to Clone a Mammoth</i> demonstrates how de-extinction will redefine conservation's future.</p></p><p><p>"Bringing a lost species back to life is an exciting prospect and also a scary one. No one is better able to explain the challenges and the potential of the enterprise than Beth Shapiro. <i>How to Clone a Mammoth</i> is an engaging, rigorous, and deeply thoughtful book."<b>--Elizabeth Kolbert, author of <i>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</i></b></p><p>"<i>How to Clone a Mammoth</i> is essential reading. Describing the cutting-edge science, and tackling the misleading ideas, surrounding de-extinction, this book immerses us in current discussions as well as the debates that are sure to come."<b>--Joel L.

Having expanded far beyond the Beat scene that first brought his work to the public ear and eye, Snyder has produced a broad-ranging body of work that encompasses his fluency in Eastern literature and culture, his commitment to the environment, and his concepts of humanity&#x2019;s place in the cosmos.<br><br>Prose selections include journals from his travels to Saigon, Singapore, Kyoto, Ceylon, New Delhi, and Dharamshala; key interviews from the East West Journal and The Paris Review, meditations on Buddhism and the surrender of self; a cultural survey of communal living; and notes from the lookout tower on Sourdough Mountain, where in stark isolation Snyder once watched for forest fires.<br><br><i>The Reader</i> gathers poems from each phase of Snyder&#x2019;s long career?from his fist collection, Riprap, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning Turtle Island, through his epic poem cycle that was forty years in the making, Mountains and Rivers Without End.<br><br>From freighter to firetower, Zendo to Himalayan mountain ridge, Snyder&#x2019;s writings reflect a lifetime of study, journey, and the practice of everyday mindfulness. Gary Snyder has witnessed and captured our culture at the hinge of change and?time and again?his work has transformed us just as it has altered our understanding of literature and place in a purposeful life.<br></p><p>Gary Snyder has published sixteen books of poetry and prose. His book Turtle Island won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1975. Since 1970 he has lived with his family in the watershed of the South Yuba River, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Northern California.Introducing this generous selection of the most appealing of the Beat writers, Jim Dodge says he changed his college major from fisheries management to "interdisciplinary studies, incorporating biology, English, and journalism" after reading Snyder's "Hay for the Horses." That early poem, from <i>Riprap</i> (1959), is Snyder's "Stopping By Woods" or "Richard Cory" --the one of his poems that, once read, is never forgotten, perhaps because, like Frost's and Robinson's chestnuts, it makes a statement about life's meaning, albeit a much more sanguine one than the great New Englanders' poems make. It appears in Dodge's remarks and again among the other poems in the collection. May it change other lives, though if one is resistant to poetry, there is twice as much of Snyder's prose here, concerned with nature, environmental consciousness, mythology, and, underlying it all, Buddhism, of which Snyder has long been a major practical Western exponent. Snyder is a man who lives healthily in the world, and any of his work is likely to change lives. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>General Motors Full-Size Trucks, 1970-79 (Chilton&#39;s Total Car Care Repair Manual) (Chilton Total Car Care Series Manuals)</h2><p>Total Car Care is the most complete, step-by-step automotive repair manual you&#39;ll ever use.

Mise en Place<p></p> <br>If you&#x2019;ve ever read my work, you know by now that I consider almost nothing random.<br> <br>If I&#x2019;m cradling a question in my heart, to be shown the right direction I pay intense attention to the answers that come, no matter what delivery service God may use. License plates, billboards, songs on the radio, comments from strangers, all become grist for my own spiritual mill.<br> <br>So my ears perked up like a Labrador one time when a stately, white-haired Frenchman turned to me in the produce aisle of the grocery store and exclaimed, &#x201c;Mise en place, it&#x2019;s ALL about mise en place, n&#x2019;est-ce pas? It&#x2019;s the consummate key!&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded and thanked him, though I had no idea what the hell he was talking about. I made a note to check when I got home, but if you&#x2019;re a cook, you may already know.<br> <br>I discovered mise en place is a French phrase for prepping all the ingredients for a meal: getting everything washed, chopped, and in order. Some people would even include cleaning and readying the kitchen. That way, when it&#x2019;s time, you can cook with abandon.<br> <br>Well, I couldn&#x2019;t think of a better message. I could feel in my bones that a big wave of new life was lurking right around the bend.<br> <br>So get ready! Clean out the closets, finish up loose ends, get rid of what needs to go. Create a vacuum for the New to fill. Release dead weight, old destructive habits, exhausting relationships. Pick a few items off the procrastination list and whisk them away.<br> <br>And if the Divine wants to make a delicious meal out of you, well, you&#x2019;ll be prepared.<br><br>Change me Divine Beloved into One who easily releases all that&#x2019;s ready to go, making room for what wants to come. May I courageously release all that is outgrown and stagnant, preparing for the new.

Reprint.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell Marsh <br> 1900 - 1949 <br><br> Born in Atlanta in 1900, Margaret Mitchell grew up surrounded by relatives who told endless tales of the Civil War and Reconstruction. She knew those who were relics of a de-stroyed culture, and those who had put aside gentility for survival. Her mother instilled in her that education was her only security. She attended Smith College but had to come home when her mother fell ill. After her mother's death, Margaret resolved that she had to make a home for her father and brother, so she left college and returned to Atlanta. <br><br> In 1923, she became a feature writer for the Atlanta Journal, and in 1925, she married John Marsh, a public relations officer for Georgia Power. She found most of her assignments unfulfilling, and she soon left to try writing fiction more to her own taste. Her own harshest critic, she would not try to get her work published. She began to write Gone with the Wind in 1926, while recovering from an automobile accident. Over the next eight years she painstakingly researched for historical accuracy. <br><br>She accumulated thousands of pages of manuscript. Here is how she later described her life's labor: "When I look back on these last years of struggling to find time to write between deaths in the family, illness in the family and among friends which lasted months and even years, childbirths (not my own), divorces and neuroses among friends, my own ill health and four fine auto accidents ... it all seems like a nightmare. I wouldn't tackle it again for anything. Just as soon as I sat down to write, somebody I loved would decide to have their gall-bladder removed. ... " <br><br> In 1934, an editor from Macmillan's Publishers came to Atlanta seeking new authors. He was referred to John and Margaret Marsh as people who knew Atlanta's literary scene. She steered him to several prospects, but didn't mention her own work. A friend told him that she was writing a novel, but she denied it. On the night before he was to leave Atlanta, she appeared at his hotel-room door with her still imperfect, mountainous manuscript and left it with him for better or for worse. <br><br> The rest of the story is well-known&#x201c;Pushing the bounds of the Richter Scale, the nine stories in <i>Last Day on Earth</i> are going to shake up the story world."&nbsp; (Adam Johnson, author of Fortune Smiles)</p><h2>Natural History of the Point Reyes Peninsula (Volume 94) (California Natural History Guides)</h2><p>Jules Evens weaves history, science, and personal anecdote into an absorbing chronicle of one of the most biologically diverse places in North America. His account of this enchanted &#34;island in time,&#34; separated by tectonics from the rest of the continent, provides a comprehensive overview of the Point Reyes Peninsula, exploring its dynamic character and its haunting appeal. Evens thoroughly investigates the climate, geology, and flora and fauna of Point Reyes, giving special attention to its most characteristic species and their ecological relationships. He delves into the past as well, evoking images of salmon-swollen creeks, herds of elk, and canyons echoing with the cries of cougars to enliven our imagination and set the stage as he traces the changes that have occurred at Point Reyes since the first Spanish explorers visited its shores in the late 1500s. Extensively illustrated with color photographs, original illustrations, and maps, the book also includes species lists for the reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, common invertebrates, fish, and plants found on the peninsula today, making it an essential companion for anyone who plans to visit one of California&#39;s most unique natural areas.</p><p>"In the past 40 years an amazing amount of data has been accumulated and analyzed on all aspects of the natural history of Point Reyes. Jules Evens has taken the difficult job of tackling an almost impossibly complicated subject and has succeeded masterfully. <i>Natural History of the Point Reyes Peninsula</i> provides an overview of not just the peninsula, but also adjacent land and ocean habitats, as well as thoughtful insights gleaned from research.

The principal purpose of this substantial volume is to clarify the meaning of Hebrews, long considered a complicated and obscure book. Paul Ellingworth's fine-tooth-comb coverage of Hebrews looks at the text up close and in a broad light, enabling the reader to see the forest as well as the trees.<br>In his determined quest to understand Hebrews, Ellingworth begins with a detailed study of the Greek text, working outward to consider the wider context, linguistic questions, and the relation of Hebrews to other early Christian writings and to the Old Testament. Nonbiblical writings such as Philo and the Dead Sea Scrolls, though less directly related to Hebrews, are considered where appropriate.<br>Unveiling the discourse structure of this carefully written letter, Ellingworth's commentary helps make coherent sense of the complexities of Hebrews. As a result of his exhaustive study, Ellingworth finds Hebrews to be primarily a pastoral, not a polemical, writing. Showing how Hebrews beautifully emphasizes the supremacy of Christ, Ellingworth concludes that the essential purpose of the epistle - which maintains the continuity of God's people before and after Christ - is to encourage readers to base their lives on nothing other and nothing less than Jesus.<br>A substantive bibliography and a comprehensive introduction precede Ellingworth's commentary, and three indexes - of subjects, authors, and Greek words discussed - conclude the volume.</p><p>Paul Ellingworth is translation consultant for the United Bible Societies in the United Kingdom and an honorary lecturer in New Testament at the University of Aberdeen. He is also the coauthor of A Translator&#39;s Handbook on the Letter to the Hebrews and author of the volume on Hebrews in the Epworth Commentaries series</p><h2>The Architecture of Red Vienna, 1919-1934</h2><p><p><b>In this book, Eve Blau looks at how ideological conflict shapedthe buildings of Red Vienna&#x2015;in terms of their program, spatialconception, language, and use&#x2015;as well as how political meaning itselfis manifested in architecture.</b></p><p>In 1919 the Social Democrat city council of Vienna initiated a radical program of reforms designed to reshape the city's infrastructure along socialist lines. The centerpiece and most enduring achievement of "Red" Vienna was the construction of the Wiener Gemeindebauten, 400 communal housing blocks, distributed throughout the city, in which workers' dwellings were incorporated with kindergartens, libraries, medical clinics, theaters, cooperative stores, and other public facilities. The 64,000 units housed one tenth of the city's population. Throughout this socialist building campaign, however, Austria was ruled by a conservative, clerical, and antisocialist political majority. Thus the architecture of Red Vienna took shape in the midst of highly charged, and often violent, political conflict between left and right. In this book, Eve Blau looks at how that ideological conflict shaped the buildings of Red Vienna&#x2015;in terms of their program, spatial conception, language, and use&#x2015;as well as how political meaning itself is manifested in architecture. She shows how the architecture of Red Vienna constructed meaning in relation to the ideological conflicts that defined Austrian politics in the interwar period&#x2015;how it was shaped by the conditions of its making, and how it engaged its own codes, practices, and history to stake out a political position in relation to those conditions. Her investigation sheds light both on the complex relationship among political program, architectural practice, and urban history in interwar Vienna, and on the process by which architecture can generate a collective discourse that includes all members of society. Published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program.</p></p><p>Eve Blau is Lecturer in Architecture at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University.<p>Eve Blau has written the first rigorous and comprehensive English-Language analysis of the extraordinary housing policy implemented in Vienna, without disguising its fatal contradictions.

In this book he synthesizes a radical theory of religion. Rituals in a great many societies deny the transience of life and of human institutions. Bloch argues that they enact this denial by symbolically sacrificing the participants themselves, so allowing them to participate in the immortality of a transcendent entity. Such sacrifices are achieved through acts of symbolic violence, ranging from bodily mutilations to the killing of animals. The theme is developed with reference to rituals of many types, from a variety of ethnographic sources, and Bloch shows that even exogamous marriage rituals can be reinterpreted in the light of this thesis. He concludes by considering the indirect relation of symbolic and ritual violence to political violence.</p><p>According to the author&#39;s radical theory of religion, many societies deny the transience of life and of human institutions through symbolic sacrifice and violence. This theme is developed with reference to rituals of many types, and from a variety of ethnographic sources.&#34;Bloch presents a strong theory of human behaviour based on the discovery of a &#39;minimum irreducible structure which is common to many ritual and other religious phenomena.&#39;...I appreciate his robust theoretical reason....&#34; Robert Hamerton-Kelly, Method and Theory in the Study of Religion</p><h2>The Companion Guide to Venice (Companion Guides)</h2><p>Offers all that the visitor with a concern for beauty and for leisurely sight-seeing will require. FINANCIAL TIMES The best guide book I have ever encountered... and a book I found it impossible not to read from beginning to end. OBSERVERThere are few pleasanter ways of passing a summer&#39;s evening than sitting over a cup of coffee, and perhaps a glass of Aurum, in the Piazza San Marco. It is especially agreeable on those nights when the Venetian city band thunders away at some throbbingly romantic piece... And all the while the younger inhabitants parade around the square, chattering, flirting, quarrelling and staring at their visitors with that same unwinking gaze that Venetians have turned on their guests for the past five centuries. The facade of San Marco closes the scene in a glitter of golden mosaic and a bubbling of cupolas, while the great thick red campanile stretches up into the warm mothy darkness of the summer sky. Hugh Honour, it is clear, knows Venice exceptionally well and catches the rhythms of the city&#39;s life with unerring skill. His guide, with its winning blend of evocative detail and precise information, spurs the reader to investigate Venice&#39;s wonders: Piazza San Marco is only the beginning of a journey into the heart of Venice and its history.</p><p>It offers all that the visitor with a concern for beauty and for leisurely sight-seeing will require. FINANCIAL TIMES If ever a guidebook were designed to be read as literature it is Mr Honour&#39;s.

ECONOMIST</p><h2>Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, Vol. 4, 1938-1940</h2><p><p><br>"Every line we succeed in publishing today...is a victory wrested from the powers of darkness." So wrote Walter Benjamin in January 1940. Not long afterward, he himself would fall prey to those powers, a victim of suicide following a failed attempt to flee the Nazis. However insistently the idea of catastrophe hangs over Benjamin's writings in the final years of his life, the "victories wrested" in this period nonetheless constitute some of the most remarkable twentieth-century analyses of the emergence of modern society. The essays on Charles Baudelaire are the distillation of a lifetime of thinking about the nature of modernity. They record the crisis of meaning experienced by a civilization sliding into the abyss, even as they testify to Benjamin's own faith in the written word.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>This volume ranges from studies of Baudelaire, Brecht, and the historian Carl Jochmann to appraisals of photography, film, and poetry. At their core is the question of how art can survive and thrive in a tumultuous time. Here we see Benjamin laying out an ethic for the critic and artist--a subdued but resilient heroism. At the same time, he was setting forth a sociohistorical account of how art adapts in an age of violence and repression. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Working at the height of his powers to the very end, Benjamin refined his theory of the mass media that culminated in the final version of his essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility." Also included in this volume is his influential piece "On the Concept of History," completed just before his death. The book is remarkable for its inquiry into the nature of "the modern" (especially as revealed in Baudelaire), for its ideas about the transmogrification of art and the radical discontinuities of history, and for its examples of humane life and thought in the midst of barbarism. The entire collection is eloquent testimony to the indomitable spirit of humanity under siege.<br></p></p><p>Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) was the author of many works of literary and cultural analysis.The variety of subjects and the grace of a style that shines though even in translation help explain Benjamin's reputation as one of our... shrewdest commentators on literature and culture. (Frank Day <i>South Caroline Review</i>)<br><br>Harvard's systematic presentation of the work of German cultural critic Benjamin has proved a revelation...This is another splendid volume. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Readers new to Benjamin will find this a welcome introduction to a challenging but rewarding writer. Those already familiar with his work will be grateful to be reminded, once again, of the wisdom of his maxim, "all the decisive blows are struck left-handed." (Graham McCann <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>The edition at hand...represents the first serious attempt to present his works with systematic chronology, judicious but inclusive selection, and sensitively accurate translation. The effect is nothing less than electric. (Peter Brier <i>Macgrill's Literary Annual</i>)<br><br>The latest volume of Havard's majestic annoted edition [is] exhilarating...You feel smarter just holding this book in your hand. (Michael Dirda <i>Washington Post Book World</i>)<br><br>Whenever [Benjamin] turned his incisive gaze...the clarity of morning's first light shines forth. (Haim Chertok <i>Jerusalem Post</i>)<br><br>A glance at the table of contents...shows us at once Benjamin's provocativeness and his infinite variety. (Marshall Berman <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br>There is nothing like Benjamin, and I can hardly imagine a more rewarding book being published this year. (David Wheatley <i>Irish Times (Dublin)</i>)<br><br>The final volume in this collection of the German philosopher's writing, this title covers the last three years of Benjamin's life and is masterfully translated, edited, and annotated. Presented here are Benjamin's grandest themes: the arcades of Paris, Baudelaire, the concept of remembrance, and materialist theology. Also included is the third version of Benjamin's most famous essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility," which was unpublished in the author's lifetime. This essay alone makes the volume indispensable for any scholar of interwar literature, philosophy, or modern European thought. Together with the first three volumes in the set (1996-2002), this is one of the most remarkable editorial achievements in contemporary thought and politics. (M.

This fascinating book focuses on fifteen pioneering cartoonists&#x2014;ranging from Winsor McCay to Chris Ware&#x2014;who brought this genre to the highest level of artistic expression and who had the greatest impact on the development of the form.<p></p>Organized chronologically, <i>Masters of American Comics </i>explores the rise of newspaper comic strips and comic books and considers their artistic development throughout the century. Presenting a wide selection of original drawings as well as progressive proofs, vintage printed Sunday pages, and comic books themselves, the authors also look at how the art of comics was transformed by artistic innovation as well as by changes in popular taste, economics, and printing conventions.<p></p>First appearing in newspaper Sunday supplements, the comic strip became immediately successful and created the largest audience of any medium of its time. The comic book first began as a way to print existing newspaper comics, then subsequently established the mass popularity of superheroes in the 1940s and 1950s before it matured as a vehicle for independent personal expression in the underground comic books and graphic novels of the 1960s.<p></p>Included in the book are insightful and entertaining essays on individual artists written by major figures in the fields of comics, narrative illustration, literature, popular culture, and art history. <i>Masters of American Comics </i>convincingly positions the genre of comics into the history of art and is destined to become a classic text for years to come.<p></p></p><p><b>JOHN CARLIN</b> is an independent writer and curator, specializing in the history of comics.

He has written and edited more than a dozen books, including <i>The Comics Since 1945.<p></p></i>This ambitious new book from Yale accompanies an exhibition of the same title debuting this fall at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. Both focus on the 15 "Masters" of American comics, including George Herriman, Jack Kirby and R. Crumb. Well known figure like Jules Feiffer, Pete Hamill and Matt Groening, among others, contribute essays on each of the artists. These are complemented by a 175-page essay by Carlin, "Art History of 20th Century American Comics." Unfortunately, this essay is a disorganized and overly academic attempt to tell the story of comics through just these 15 artists, with little context for their achievements, thus failing to elucidate what makes them so special. Going too far the other way, the individual essays vary wildly in depth and intent. Jonathan Safran Foer's piece is little more than a memory of his friendship with Art Spiegelman, while Brian Walker casts much needed light on Lyonel Feininger's little known cartooning career. If the book is an uneven example of scholarship, it will still deserve a place on the comics reference table for the lavish number of full-color pages celebrating the glorious achievements of the cartoonists profiled. They show what the text sometimes doesn't: the vital impact these artists have had on the form. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book explores these two strains of modern Japanese photography through the work of two remarkable figures: Hiroshi Hamaya and Kansuke Yamamoto.<br><br>Hiroshi Hamaya (1915&#x2013;1999) was born and raised in Tokyo and, after an initial period of creative experimentation, turned his attention to recording traditional life and culture on the coast of the Sea of Japan. In 1940 he began photographing the New Year&#x2019;s rituals in a remote village, which was published as <i>Yukiguni </i>(Snow country). He went on to record cultural changes in China, political protests in Japan, and landscapes around the world.<br><br>Kansuke Yamamoto (1914&#x2013;1987) became fascinated by the innovative approaches in art and literature exemplified by such Western artists as Man Ray, Ren� Magritte, and Yves Tanguy. He promoted Surrealist and avant-garde ideas in Japan through his poetry, paintings, sculptures, and photographs.<br><br>Along with essays by the book&#x2019;s coeditors, Judith Keller and Amanda Maddox, are essays by Kotaro Iizawa, Ryuichi Kaneko, and Jonathan M. Reynolds, life chronologies, and a selection of poems by Yamamoto translated by John Solt.

By that measure, writes British museologist Richard Rudgley, many societies of the most ancient Stone Age are to be reckoned as civilizations, for new archaeological evidence suggests that the Neolithic writing systems of cultures like Mesopotamia and the Nile valley have their roots in even older systems, some dating back to the time of the Neanderthals. (Just what those writing systems say remains a matter of debate, and Rudgley acknowledges that "if a script cannot be deciphered, then it will always be possible to dismiss it.") Prehistoric sign systems aside, Rudgley urges that the chronology of human cultural evolution be pushed back well into the Paleolithic; "the most fundamental cultural innovations," he suggests, "actually occurred far earlier in the overall sequence [of human development] than is generally realized." He maintains, for instance, that fired pottery, another characteristic of civilized societies, existed among Siberian nomads some 13,000 years ago, and that a knowledge of metallurgy existed in Egypt 35,000 years ago. Any call for a revision in widely accepted chronologies is, of course, sure to be controversial among prehistorians, and Rudgley's book, well reasoned as it is, will provoke debate. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>An authoritative, eye-opening look at Stone Age civilizations that explodes traditional portrayals of prehistory<p>The rise of historical civilization 5,000 years ago is often depicted as if those societies were somehow created out of nothing. However, recent discoveries of astonishing accomplishments from the Neolithic Age -- in art, technology, writing, math, science, religion, medicine and exploration -- demand a fundamental rethinking of humanity before the dawn of written history.</p><p>In this fascinating book, Richard Rudgley describes how<br>-- The intrepid explorers of the Stone Age discovered all of the world's major land masses long before the so-called Age of Discovery<br>-- Stone Age man performed medical operations, including amputations and delicate cranial surgeries<br>-- Paleolithic cave artists of Western Europe used techniques that were forgotten until the Renaissance<br>-- Prehistoric life expectancy was better than it is for contemporary third-world populations</p><p>Rudgley reminds us just how savage so-called civilized people can be, and demonstrates how the cultures that have been reviled as savage were truly civilized. The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age shows the great debt that contemporary society owes to its prehistoric predecessors. It is a rich introduction to a lost world that will redefine the meaning of civilization itself.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Fluid Mechanics</h2><p>One of the bestselling books in the field, <i>Introduction to Fluid Mechanics</i> continues to provide readers with a balanced and comprehensive approach to mastering critical concepts.

It was the sound of eighteen hundred airplanes approaching Hamburg from the south at an unimaginable height. We had already experienced two hundred or even more air raids, among them some very heavy ones, but this was something completely new. And yet there was an immediate recognition: this was what everyone had been waiting for, what had hung for months like a shadow over everything we did, making us weary. It was the end.</i><br><br>Novelist Hans Erich Nossack was forty-two when the Allied bombardments of German cities began, and he watched the destruction of Hamburg&#x2014;the city where he was born and where he would later die&#x2014;from across its Elbe River. He heard the whistle of the bombs and the singing of shrapnel; he watched his neighbors flee; he wondered if his home&#x2014;and his manuscripts&#x2014;would survive the devastation. <i>The End</i> is his terse, remarkable memoir of the annihilation of the city, written only three months after the bombing. A searing firsthand account of one of the most notorious events of World War II, <i>The End</i> is also a meditation on war and hope, history and its devastation. And it is the rare book, as W. G. Sebald noted, that describes the Allied bombing campaign from the German perspective.<br><br>In the first English-language edition of <i>The End,</i> Nossack's text has been crisply translated by Joel Agee and is accompanied by the photographs of Erich Andres. Poetic, evocative, and yet highly descriptive, <i>The End</i> will prove to be, as Sebald claimed, one of the most important German books on the firebombing of that country. <br><br>"A small but critical book, something to read in those quiet moments when we wonder what will happen next."&#x2014;Susan Salter Reynolds, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br></p><p><b>Hans Erich Nossack</b> (1901-77) was a prolific writer. His books T<i>he D'Arthez Case, To the Unknown Hero, The Impossible Proof, Wait for November,</i> and <i>An Offering for the Dead</i> have been translated into English.German novelist Nossack&#x2019;s brief (63 pages in this edition) contemporary account of the 1943 destruction of Hamburg by Allied bombardment is one of the small number of works available in English that deal with the events of those years from a German perspective. Its publication is clearly owed to its mention in another book, the late W.G. Sebald&#x2019;s best-selling and controversial On the Natural History of Destruction, which speaks highly of Nossack&#x2019;s account. The narrative is indeed clear-eyed and dispassionate, possessed of the emotional distance necessary to regard the terrible events in their totality. The account begins as Nossack and his wife are on holiday in the city&#x2019;s idyllic rural outskirts; the reader is then carried through wave after wave of firebombing and retrenchment to the point of total devastation; the confusion and horror of events are rendered with immediacy and power. (Also included are 11 contemporary halftone Erich Andres photographs.) What&#x2019;s missing from Nossack&#x2019;s account is any political or historical dimension: a reader coming to this book for primary knowledge would learn little about why the bombings took place, or why so many people accepted them with numb resignation instead of anger. But as a supplement to Sebald&#x2019;s more detailed consideration, Nossack&#x2019;s remarkable witnessing has real and urgent value.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first account of the gods of Irish myth to take in the whole sweep of Irish literature in both the nation&#x2019;s languages, the book describes how Ireland&#x2019;s pagan divinities were transformed into literary characters in the medieval Christian era&#x2015;and how they were recast again during the Celtic Revival of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A lively narrative of supernatural beings and their fascinating and sometimes bizarre stories, Mark Williams&#x2019;s comprehensive history traces how these gods&#x2015;known as the <i>T�atha D� Danann</i>&#x2015;have shifted shape across the centuries, from Iron Age cult to medieval saga to today&#x2019;s young-adult fiction.</p><p>We meet the heroic Lug; the Morr�gan, crow goddess of battle; the fire goddess Brigit, who moonlights as a Christian saint; the mist-cloaked sea god Manann�n mac Lir; and the ageless fairies who inspired J.R.R. Tolkien&#x2019;s immortal elves. Medieval clerics speculated that the Irish divinities might be devils, angels, or enchanters. W. B. Yeats invoked them to reimagine the national condition, while his friend George Russell beheld them in visions and understood them to be local versions of Hindu deities. The book also tells how the Scots repackaged Ireland&#x2019;s divine beings as the gods of the Gael on both sides of the sea&#x2015;and how Irish mythology continues to influence popular culture far beyond Ireland.</p><p>An unmatched chronicle of the Irish gods, <i>Ireland&#x2019;s Immortals</i> illuminates why these mythical beings have loomed so large in the world&#x2019;s imagination for so long.</p></p><p><p>"In 1896, George Russell wrote to W. B. Yeats announcing that &#x2018;the Gods have returned' to Celtic realms; Mark Williams's brilliant and powerful book makes good the claim. Learned, discursive, masterfully organized, and often very funny, it illuminates the cults, characters, personalities, and uses of Irish divinities from their emergence in saga, pseudohistory, and folklore through to their exploitation in the Celtic Revival and the literature of fantasy, and their analysis in modern scholarship. This is an important contribution to the history of religion, nationalism, and Gaelic culture; it is also so well written as to be unputdownable."<b>--R. F.

It should delight a very big readership."<b>--Ronald E. Hutton, University of Bristol</b></p><p>"This magnificent book is a tour de force and a great leap forward in the study of Irish mythology.

Clarke demonstrates that Munch was thoroughly in control of his artistic identity, a savvy businessman skilled in responding to the market and shaping popular opinion. Moreover, the author shows that Munch was keenly aware of the art world of his day, adopting motifs, styles, and techniques from a wide variety of sources, including many Scandinavian artists. By presenting Munch&#x2019;s paintings, prints, and drawings in relation to those of European contemporaries, including Harriet Backer, James Ensor, Vincent van Gogh, Max Klinger, Christian Krohg, and Claude Monet, Clarke reveals often surprising connections and influences. This interpretive approach, grounded in Munch&#x2019;s diaries and letters, period criticism, and the artworks themselves, reintroduces Munch as an artist who cultivated myths both visual and personal. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Becoming Edvard Munch </i>features beautiful color reproductions of approximately 150 works, including 75 paintings and 75 works on paper by Munch and his peers. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Jay A.

With a novelist's wit and eye for telling detail, Rothchild chronicles the financial escapades of this eccentric, pioneering clan, providing a vivid portrait of fifty years of Wall Street history along the way. Rothchild shadows the Davis family's holdings through two lengthy bull markets, two savage and seven mild bear markets, one crash, and twenty-five corrections and, in the process, reveals the strategies behind the family's uncanny ability to consistently beat the markets.<br> The Davis Dynasty begins in 1947, the year Shelby Davis quit his job as a state bureaucrat and, armed with $50,000 of his wife's money, took the plunge into stock investing. By the time he died in 1994, he had multiplied his wife's original stake 8,000 times! The story continues with his son, Shelby, who established one of the most successful funds of the past thirty years. The final characters in this enthralling family saga are grandsons Chris and Andrew. Both surrendered to the Davis family passion for investing and both went on to earn reputations as investment luminaries in their own right.<br> John Rothchild (Miami Beach, FL) co-wrote the blockbusters One Up on Wall Street, Beating the Street, and Learn to Earn with Peter Lynch. He is the author of Survive and Profit in Ferocious Markets (Wiley: 0-471-34882-1), A Fool and His Money (Wiley: 0-471-25138-0), and Going for Broke. He has written for Harper's, Rolling Stone, Esquire, and other leading magazines and he has appeared on the Today Show, the Nightly Business Report, and CNBC.</p><p>"I remember attending a company meeting with Shelby Cullom Davis when he was in his seventies. Even then it was obvious he was taking the best notes. This is really two books in one. It is the story of a rarity in the investment business: a family whose money management skills have evolved and been passed on from the patriarch to two succeeding generations. It is also a how-to book on common sense investing. As the dot.com phase passes into history, the book provides some useful lessons on how fortunes are built and then used for constructive purposes."--Byron R. Wien, Chief U.S. Investment Strategist, Morgan Stanley <p> "When John Rothchild combines history and biography with investing in one package, history illuminates the biography and investing, biography illuminates the history and investing, and investing illuminates the history and biography. This is a sparkling book on each level, but even more so as an adroitly mixed cocktail of all three."--Peter Bernstein, Author of <i>THE POWER OF GOLD</i></p>The story of the Davis dynasty is, in many ways, the story of Wall Street over the last half century. John Rothchild's sweeping saga chronicles the changing face of Wall Street alongside the financial escapades of one of America's most successful, yet unheralded investing families.<br> <br> Three generations of the Davis family portfolio-patriarch Shelby Cullom Davis, son Shelby, and grandsons Chris and Andrew-take you through the canyons of Wall Street as they consistently beat the market with a growth-at-a-reasonable price philosophy and a passion for investing.<br> <br> Born into a middle-class family in Peoria, Illinois, Shelby Cullom Davis was more interested in history than finance. That all changed in 1947 when, at age thirty-eight, he left his job as a New York State Insurance Department bureaucrat and plunged into investing using $50,000 of his wife's money. In the late 1940s, as the Dow reeled at 180 and Wall Street ignored insurance stocks, Davis went with what he knew best and built a dynasty from a plain-vanilla portfolio of insurance stocks.<br> <br> With proven strategies and a frugal spending philosophy, Davis amassed a fortune from the postwar bull market of the 1950s through the glorious market of the 1980s. He passed his experience on to future generations but left nearly $900 million in trust for conservative causes, forcing his family to continue the dynasty on their own merits.<br> <br> Son Shelby Davis took on Wall Street during the go-go market of the 1960s. He started a small investment firm and took control of the fledgling New York Venture Fund, which beat the market twenty-two of the twenty-eight years he operated it. Navigating the inflationary market of the 1970s was tricky, but Shelby emerged unscathed. Grandsons Andrew and Chris steered the Davis dynasty through the 1990s and continue into a new century as they use the refined financial strategies of the Davis family to challenge Wall Street and manage Davis Convertible and Real Estate Funds.<br> <br> Although markets may change, the tradition of financial expertise does not. The Davis dynasty, built on the belief of "compounding machines"-companies that could multiply your investment-and the idea that long-term investing lasts a lifetime, has passed through two lengthy bull markets, two savage and seven mild bear markets, one crash, and twenty-five corrections.<br> <br> With The Davis Dynasty, John Rothchild presents the Davis family, their investment philosophy, and Wall Street within a historical and literary narrative that is informative, entertaining, and engaging. Take a once-in-a-lifetime journey through Wall Street with one of the most successful investing families in America and watch how a dynasty was built.</p><h2>Liber 420: Cannabis, Magickal Herbs and the Occult</h2><p>Although little known, cannabis and other psychoactive plants held a prominent and important role in the Occult arts of Alchemy and Magic, as well as being used in ritual initiations of certain secret societies. Find out about the important role cannabis played in helping to develop modern medicines through alchemical works. Cannabis played a pivotal role in spagyric alchemy, and appears in the works of alchemists such as Zosimos, Avicenna, Llull, Paracelsus, Cardano and Rabelais. Cannabis also played a pivotal role in medieval and renaissance magic and recipes with instructions for its use appear in a number of influential and important grimoires such as the Picatrix, Sepher Raxiel: Liber Salomonis, and The Book of Oberon. Could cannabis be the Holy Grail? With detailed historical references, the author explores the allegations the Templars were influenced by the hashish ingesting Assassins of medieval Islam, and that myths of the Grail are derived from the Persian traditions around the sacred beverage known as haoma, which was a preparation of cannabis,opium and other drugs. Many of the works discussed, have never been translated into English, or published in centuries. The unparalleled research in this volume makes it a potential perennial classic on the subjects of both medieval and renaissance history of cannabis, as well as the role of plants in the magical and occult traditions.</p><p>CA&#x201c;Bennett has done it again.

It is an Excellent book&#x2014;very well researched. Even if you are not interested in cannabis, it is an excellent survey of the development of magic, alchemy, the Templars and Freemasonry from a fresh perspective. 777 pages of well written information with many B/W illustrations never seen before." &#x2014;Stephen Skinner, Author of <i>Sacred Geometry: Deciphering the Code and Techniques of Solomonic Magic</i><br><br>"With legalization of cannabis a central theme in politics today, the timing could not be better for this information to reach the public. This book should be sold in every dispensary. The abundant proof from a wide variety of sources, and the internal consistency of the patterns revealed, leave little doubt that even the most illustrious among our spiritual ancestors knew not only the usefulness of hemp, and the healing qualities of cannabis, but also the entheogenic properties of THC." &#x2014;Ronnie Pontiac,<i>&nbsp;Newtopia Magazine </i></p><h2>The Passionate, Accurate Story: Making Your Heart&#39;s Truth into Literature</h2><p>A book about how to write, generally, and with much attention paid to how to write the short story How to use empathic inquiry instead of conventional literary critiquing methods.</p><p>&#34;Escape has its value, of course, like dessert: It is not food . . .&#34; Here, short-story writer Bly teaches you how to cook up tales that--in a time of nukes, greenhouse gas, and ozone holes--matter.

I devoted much of the afternoon to crafting a response to a listener who disliked a story that had aired the previous day on <i>All Things Considered</i>. When you cover a beat such as religion, as I did for many years at National Public Radio, you brace for a hailstorm of outraged e-mails every time you file a report. <br>But I never grew used to them, and this one was particularly up- setting. &nbsp;Just after I sent off my response, I felt a sharp pain in my chest. My breathing became clipped and shallow. &nbsp;Heat radiated up my back. &nbsp;Panicked, I googled &#x201c;heart attack + women.&#x201d; &nbsp;The results were not reassuring&#x2014;are any health-related answers on the Internet reassuring?&#x2014;and I called my doctor, Brad Moore, on his cell phone. I described my symptoms as calmly as I could.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like the shortness of breath,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I want you to call<br> 911 immediately.&#x201d;<br><br>I made it partway through &#x201c;I can do that,&#x201d; when the room lurched and went black. &nbsp;When I opened my eyes, my colleague John Ydstie was tucking a soft sweater under my head. &#x201c;An ambulance is on its way<i>,&#x201d; </i>he whispered. Then I heard Scott Simon&#x2019;s voice directing the medics to my cubicle. Dr. Moore, who also sees Scott, had called him when he heard me faint. <br><br>By the time the ambulance reached the George Washington University Hospital, I was feeling pretty good, well enough to go home, in fact. I explained to the nurse that I was a healthy woman who takes a six a.m. spinning class every day. I could not possibly have a bad heart. The nurse looked at me, handed me a hospital gown, and scanned her notes.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fifty-three, right?&#x201d; she asked, as if that number were a clinical condition, like diabetes. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;d better keep you overnight.&#x201d; <br><br>It occurred &nbsp;to &nbsp;me then &nbsp;that &nbsp;I <i>was </i>suffering &nbsp;from &nbsp;a condition: &nbsp;a physical &nbsp;and emotional&nbsp; &nbsp;condition&nbsp; &nbsp;called &nbsp;&#x201c;midlife.&#x201d; This &nbsp;condition presented &nbsp;as &nbsp;a &nbsp;disconnect between &nbsp;my &nbsp;thirty-something&nbsp; self-image and my fifty-something &nbsp;reality. &nbsp;I recognized it every time I passed a mirror and saw the lined face of my mother in her fifties staring back at me. I spotted &nbsp;it often &nbsp;at work, &nbsp;when &nbsp;my younger, &nbsp;ambitious &nbsp;self insisted that &nbsp;I clamor to cover that &nbsp;breaking &nbsp;story, while my chronological self shrugged, preferring &nbsp;a good night&#x2019;s &nbsp;sleep to another &nbsp;all-nighter. &nbsp;Sitting there in the thin hospital robe, I admitted &nbsp;there were moments, &nbsp;more &nbsp;and &nbsp;more &nbsp;frequent, &nbsp;when &nbsp;I seemed to be pushing &nbsp;a wheelbarrow full of dense, unfulfilled ambition&nbsp; up a steep gravel path. It was exhausting, but I didn&#x2019;t know any other way to live.<br><br>I was not left to my thoughts for long. Within minutes, my husband, Devin; my brother, Dave; Dr. &nbsp;Moore; &nbsp;and &nbsp;Marty &nbsp;Makary, &nbsp;a good &nbsp;friend &nbsp;and &nbsp;surgeon &nbsp;at Johns &nbsp;Hopkins, had &nbsp;arrived, &nbsp;creating &nbsp;a little &nbsp;party &nbsp;in our &nbsp;corner &nbsp;of the &nbsp;ER. As the five of us chatted and laughed, e-mails from NPR friends and colleagues began filling my iPhone; someone had sent an All Staff e-mail. My dear friend Libby Lewis called to say she would visit early the next morning. I felt loved, I felt cherished. Why hadn&#x2019;t I pulled this stunt before? <br><br>Eventually everyone left, and I was given a bed at two a.m. I awakened with a dull headache a couple of hours later to a persistent beeping from the bed next to me. I gazed at the ceiling, reflecting on my family and friends and how desperately I wanted a cup of coffee. At six-thirty, I called Devin to see if he could bring me a double espresso. I reached him as he was leaving the house.<br><br>&#x201c;You need to call Dave,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just call him,&#x201d; he said uncomfortably.<br><br>Instinctively, I knew: Dad had died. As it turned out, he had died at five that morning, at age ninety-one.<br><br>That night, after I was discharged from the hospital, my family and a few friends collected at my brother&#x2019;s house for dinner.<br><br>&#x201c;Turns out I was with the wrong relative last night,&#x201d; Dave quipped when he ushered us in, and it felt good to laugh.<br><br>We crowded around the kitchen table and began swapping stories about Dad. We remembered how he learned to swing dance when he was sixty-nine, and how at seventy-four, by then two years divorced, Dad spotted Nancy at church and courted her with such charm and devotion that she had to marry him. We talked about how Dad believed in me: When I was struggling in school as a third-grader, how he spent hours helping me with homework and with prayers written out on yellow legal pads. We recalled how Dad studied French every night between two and three a.m., teaching himself vocabulary and grammar. &nbsp;He never progressed &nbsp;beyond &nbsp;terrible &nbsp;at French, but&nbsp; he al- ways &nbsp;insisted &nbsp;that &nbsp;some &nbsp;things &nbsp;are &nbsp;worth &nbsp;doing &nbsp;poorly. &nbsp;I think he meant that some things are so worthwhile that even if you have no talent, even if the results are mediocre, it is still worth your time and effort. In his final years, his mind and body had failed him&#x2014;he was nearly blind, nearly deaf, and suffered from dementia&#x2014;but to the end, Dad lived each day with verve.<br> After hearing that my father had died, Scott Simon sent me a note. He had known Dad. They belonged to the same health club and would occasionally share a cup of coffee, Dad no doubt clueless as to Scott&#x2019;s fame. Scott mentioned that he had told his wife, Caroline, about my health scare and my dad&#x2019;s death.<br><br>&#x201c;Caroline said, &#x2018;Darling, I don&#x2019;t care how far gone someone is, they always feel a tug from their children. &nbsp;Gene wanted to go instead,&#x2019;&#x201d; Scott wrote. &nbsp;&#x201c;We believe that Gene somehow knew that you needed a little help and he said to God, &#x2018;Barbie still has a lot of things to do. I&#x2019;m ready. Take me,&#x2019; and he said it with that incredible chiseled smile. And God said, &#x2018;Gene, you&#x2019;ve got a deal.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Even now, several years later, these words make me cry. They re- mind me that Dad loved me fiercely and would have instantly traded his life for mine. Scott&#x2019;s words &nbsp;also illumined &nbsp;a larger truth: &nbsp;A page had &nbsp;turned, &nbsp;Dad &nbsp;was &nbsp;gone &nbsp;and &nbsp;I was &nbsp;here, ostensibly &nbsp;healthy &nbsp;but keenly aware that a hospital stay or worse was only one stressful event away. I saw it would not be too long before my brother and I would be next at bat, and that the next generation to fall was my own.<br><br>At fifty-three, I gained a new sense of my own mortality. Now, what would I do with that?<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> ONE MYTH AND THREE TRUTHS<br> &nbsp;<br>For the next two years, I examined the middle stage of life. I traveled the country interviewing brain scientists and marriage therapists, psychologists and kidney donors, geneticists and elite masters athletes&#x2014;well over four hundred &nbsp;researchers and ordinary folk trying to figure out how to thrive at midlife. As a result, I have come to believe that the forties, fifties, and sixties are the least understood and, in some ways, the most critical phase of life. Midlife is not flyover territory. &nbsp;Midlife is O&#x2019;Hare, midlife is Heathrow, midlife is a bustling hub where the decisions you make today largely determine the rest of your journey on this planet. &nbsp;What I have learned has been a happy surprise. It has changed the way I try to approach every single day. <br><br>Midlife has gotten a bum rap. It has suffered guilt by association, linked inextricably to the &#x201c;c&#x201d; word: <i>crisis</i>.<br><br>The &nbsp;ugly rumors &nbsp;about &nbsp;midlife &nbsp;began &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;1970s, when &nbsp;Gail Sheehy and others stereotyped midlife as a cataclysmic period surging with existential &nbsp;dread, &nbsp;flattened &nbsp;by malaise, tortured by one&#x2019;s failed dreams, or any combination of the three. In her book <i>Passages, </i>Sheehy wrote of the &#x201c;forlorn forties&#x201d; and the &#x201c;resigned fifties.&#x201d; Eventually the idea captured the popular imagination, becoming plot lines for Oscar- winning (and lesser) movies, and often an excuse for bad behavior. According to the midlife-crisis argument, certain stalwart or blessed personalities could escape the mud pit, but most of us were drawn inexorably into the emotional mire. We have been socialized to think this way about midlife, and&#x2014;what do you know?&#x2014;we all seem to have &#x201c;midlife crises.&#x201d;<br><br>In fact, there is almost no hard evidence for midlife crisis at all, other than a few small pilot studies conducted decades ago. Researchers today &nbsp;who &nbsp;have examined &nbsp;people across &nbsp;their &nbsp;life spans, &nbsp;peered inside their brains, uncoiled their hopes and fears, and observed how they deal with love and alienation, &nbsp;trauma &nbsp;and death, &nbsp;good and evil, say that &nbsp;midlife is about &nbsp;renewal, &nbsp;not crisis. This is a time when you shift gears&#x2014;a temporary pause, yes, but not a prolonged stall. In fact, you are moving forward to a new place in life. This moment can be exhilarating rather than terrifying, informed by the experiences of your past and shaped by the promise of your future.<br><br>This is not to say that the middle-aged are a cheerful or carefree lot. If happiness over the life span looks like a U-curve&#x2014;and researchers suggest that it does&#x2014;then people in their forties and fifties occupy the bottom of the curve. They zigzag between demanding children and frail parents. They shoulder heavy responsibilities at work. They are under-rested, under-exercised, and overfed. Yet 90 percent of them are not in crisis. Midlife malaise is fairly ubiquitous, but let&#x2019;s not diminish a legitimate phenomenon with a stereotype. <br><br>When I launched into this admittedly self-serving project&#x2014;after all, this is about me as well as you&#x2014;I knew what to examine. &nbsp;It was like being a first-time tourist to the United States, equipped with a must-see list. When you arrive in Washington, D.C., you must see the White House; in Arizona, the Grand Canyon; in New York City, the Statue of Liberty. &nbsp;But even after roaming through those places, you would not truly understand the country unless you absorbed some of its overriding motifs: democracy, the pursuit of happiness, religious freedom, and eternal optimism.<br><br>In the same way, I had my must-see list of midlife monuments: the (tedious) career, the (distant) marriage, the need for investing outward, or &#x201c;generativity,&#x201d; which psychologist Erik Erikson enshrined as a de- fining characteristic of midlife. But as I looked around, I also spotted three themes that are helpful, and I believe necessary, to living richly in one&#x2019;s middle years.<br> <i><br>Engage with verve. </i>Emotionally disengaging from any part of your life&#x2014;your spouse, your kids, your work&#x2014;cuts off the oxygen and the patient dies. That &nbsp;sounds &nbsp;dire&#x2014;that&#x2019;s &nbsp;my point, &nbsp;actually&#x2014;because this &nbsp;insight &nbsp;surfaced &nbsp;again &nbsp;and &nbsp;again: &nbsp;Autopilot&nbsp; &nbsp;is death. Choose where to invest your energy, and do so intentionally, because the clearest path to a robust midlife is purposeful engagement.<br><br>In some ways, the best role models for people over forty are people under eighteen. Children study hard, learn new skills, and throw them- selves into new passions. &nbsp;They fail like beginners, until frustration yields to success. They risk making and tending to friends, even if that hurts. The lesson for midlifers is: Of course it takes work to inject zest and &nbsp;vulnerability &nbsp;into &nbsp;your &nbsp;marriage; &nbsp;it takes &nbsp;courage &nbsp;to reappraise your career for not &nbsp;just income &nbsp;but &nbsp;also meaning; &nbsp;it takes &nbsp;effort &nbsp;to sharpen your aging brain. But the research is clear: Engaging in those things you feel are important will lift your joy and satisfaction, in the moment and over the years. <br><i><br>Choose purpose over happiness. </i>&#x201c;Happiness is overrated,&#x201d; Carol Ryff told me. Ryff is a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin and director of an enormous project called Midlife in the United States, or MIDUS. For some twenty years, Ryff and other scientists have tracked thousands of people through their middle and later years, measuring their well-being in every possible way: physically, emotionally, psycho- logically, biologically, and neurologically. &nbsp;After sorting through piles of data, the researchers have concluded that pursuing happiness can backfire, but pursuing <i>eudaimonia rarely</i> fails.<br> <i><br>Eudaimonia is</i> the Aristotelian idea of human flourishing, pursuing long-term goals that give meaning to life, rather than short-term happiness that delivers a jolt of dopamine. &nbsp;It is the kind of satisfaction that comes from raising terrific children or training for the Olympics. It means figuring out your purpose in life, given your unique set of talents and capacities. &nbsp;It is the Holy Grail that &nbsp;all people seek, most acutely in middle age, when we can see the final horizon not so many years away.<br><br>It turns out that finding a deeper purpose and pursuing it carries an unexpected bonus: It makes you robust. &nbsp;Dozens of new studies show that if you have a reason to get up in the morning, you will live longer, you will enjoy a happier old age, you will better retain your memory, and you will be more likely to not only survive the scary diagnosis but thrive. Purpose in life is more important than education or wealth in determining long-term health and happiness. It isn&#x2019;t a panacea, but it&#x2019;s awfully close. <br><br><i>Your thinking is your experience. </i>How you think can shape how you experience the world, your career, your relationships, your health, your happiness. &nbsp;Please note &nbsp;that &nbsp;I am&nbsp; <i>not &nbsp;</i>arguing &nbsp;that &nbsp;whistling &nbsp;a happy tune will make you healthy, wealthy, and wise; at least, not entirely. Much of your life and mine is shaped by biology and life circumstances. Genetics&#x2014;who your parents are, whether you are susceptible to mental or physical disease, what your emotional &#x201c;set point&#x201d; is&#x2014;this is the wind thrusting your little boat in a particular direction. &nbsp;Your environment steers you as well, with the force of a strong current: Did you grow up in a safe and nurturing home, or a divided or abusive one? Did you receive a decent education? Are you poor or wealthy? Are you married, employed, religious?<br><br>But there is also a mechanism called a &#x201c;rudder&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, your thinking, your approach to triumphs and defeats, joys and pain and losses, the stuff no one escapes&#x2014;that calibrates one&#x2019;s happiness. &nbsp;Experts believe that 30 to 40 percent of one&#x2019;s happiness is determined by how a person thinks or acts. That rudder won&#x2019;t shelter you from a hurricane as you venture across an ocean, but it will absolutely color how much you enjoy the trip.<br><br>Your thoughts and attitudes today chart your destiny tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> A CIRCUITOUS JOURNEY<br><br>If you are middle-aged today (roughly betw...</p><h2>Reforming Education: The Opening of American Mind</h2><p>A founder of the &#34;great books&#34; movement addresses the controversy concerning what should be required study in schools and suggests a humanistic course of study that is accessible to all</p><p>This collection of programmatic essays and occasional pieces argues for the restoration of form and substance to the dishwater mixture we currently call education in America.

An undiscovered genius during her lifetime, only seven out of her total of 1,775 poems were published prior to her death. She had an immense breadth of vision and a passionate intensity and awe for life, love, nature, time and eternity. Originally branded an eccentric, Emily Dickinson is now recognised as a major poet of great depth.</p><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Archibald MacLeish has noted the &#34;curious energy&#34; which pervades Emily Dickinson&#39;s work. She, along with Walt Whitman, helps make up the very foundation of American poetry. This Modern Library edition from Random House is an excellent overview of Dickinson&#39;s work, divided by theme, including &#34;Life,&#34; &#34;Nature,&#34; &#34;Love,&#34; and so forth. This volume of selected poems is a must for any serious reader of American poetry.Emily Dickinson lived as a recluse in Amherst, Massachusetts, dedicating herself to writing a &#34;letter to the world&#34;--the 1,775 poems left unpublished at her death in 1886. Today, Dickinson stands in the front rank of American poets. This enthralling collection includes more than four hundred poems that were published between Dickinson&#39;s death and 1900. They express her concepts of life and death, of love and nature, and of what Henry James called &#34;the landscape of the soul.&#34; And as Billy Collins suggests in his Introduction, &#34;In the age of the workshop, the reading, the poetry conference and festival, Dickinson reminds us of the deeply private nature of literary art.&#34;</p><h2>Seguy&#39;s Decorative Butterflies and Insects in Full Color</h2><p>These are undoubtedly the most beautiful color butterflies in all of Art Deco.

He studied what constitutes the best in a human being, and which, in turn, determines a person&#x2019;s role in the world. Blending history and biography, Plutarch evokes the characters of great leaders in history. He systematically pairs a Greek with a Roman, comparing characters and lives with similar careers so as to serve his particular goal of moral instruction. In vivid prose, he describes the awesome spectacle of the actions of men of enormous desires and ambitions responding to impossible situations.</p><p><b>Plutarch </b>most likely was born in the 40s CE to a wealthy leading family. He studied in Athens and traveled widely through Greece and the empire, from Alexandria to Rome, but remained a lifelong resident of Chaeronea in Central Greece. He held several municipal and regional offices.&nbsp;<p>The history of the Victorian Age will never be written; we know too much about it. For ignorance is the first requisite of the historian ignorance, which simplifies and clarifies, which selects and omits, with a placid perfection unattainable by the highest art.</p><p> Lytton Strachey, preface to <i>Eminent Victorians</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plutarch did not invent biography, any more than he invented the ethical essay; only the accident of transmission leaves us the impression that he did so, for almost nothing of Greek literature survives from the two centuries before him.&nbsp; Nor did he first distinguish history from biography, eschewing the complete story of the events of a life in favor of an evocation of its character, a distinction that resurfaces in the attitude exemplified by Strachey&#x2019;s dismissal of history-writing, which in its affront to scholarly history led, at the beginning of the twentieth century, to a stiffening of the traditional divide between history and biography.&nbsp; Strachey further emulates Plutarch&#x2019;s approach to biography when he calls on the biographer to attend to unexpected angles, illuminate dark corners, drop a bucket into the ocean of detail, and work with whatever characteristic specimens&#x201d; it chances to bring up.&nbsp; Plutarch explains these aspects of his biographical writings with reference to his lives of Alexander and Caesar:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have chosen rather to epitomize the most celebrated parts of their story, than to insist at large on every particular circumstance of it. It must be borne in mind that my design is not to write histories, but lives.&nbsp; The most glorious exploits do not always furnish us with the clearest discoveries of virtue or vice in men; sometimes a matter of less moment, an expression or a jest, informs us better of their characters and inclinations, than the most famous sieges, the greatest armaments, or the bloodiest battles whatsoever.&nbsp; Therefore as portrait-painters are more exact in the lines and features of the face, in which the character is seen, than in the other parts of the body, so I must be allowed to give my more particular attention to the marks and indications of the souls of men, and while I endeavour by these to portray their lives, may be free to leave more weighty matters and great battles to be treated of by others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Alexander scholars note with chagrin, Plutarch directs his attention so strictly onto his hero and his hero&#x2019;s character that military historians cannot reconstruct the battles he described so vividly.&nbsp; The parallel lives of Alexander and Caesar exemplify the two distinctive qualities of Plutarchan biography: comparative and ethical.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Hellenistic period biographers developed the serial biography to treat, for example, the kings of a country or the heads of philosophical schools.&nbsp; Plutarch followed this approach in his lives of the Roman emperors from Augustus to Vitellius, of which only <i>Galba</i> and <i>Otho</i> survive.&nbsp; Some of his predecessors treated Greeks and Romans together.&nbsp; But Plutarch&#x2019;s real contribution to the genre of biography lies in the systematic pairing and comparing of lives with similar careers and characters so as to serve his particular goal of moral instruction. That he pairs a Greek with a Roman in each case reflects, additionally, the various political or cultural intentions discussed in the introduction to volume 1.&nbsp; So, for example, the pairing of <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Caesar</i> treats two great conquerors and empire-builders, two men of enormous ambition, generosity, self-control, and mercy, who turned tyrannical at the end of their lives.&nbsp; The pair <i>Alcibiades</i> and <i>Coriolanus</i> treats two great generals who found themselves in exile leading armies against their mother cities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plutarch established a certain formality in the composition of each life within a generally but not rigorously chronological framework. A preface introduces the two subjects for comparison, and where possible Plutarch mentions a statue of the subject so as to show how appearance reflects character. He then explores the subject&#x2019;s family, education, and youth in order to show where the man&#x2019;s qualities have their origin, as well as their debut into public life.&nbsp; Plutarch then highlights the public career to show how character develops as the subject encounters adversity, success, and failure, as well as the influence of friends and enemies, good luck and bad.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can reconstruct the chronology of the composition of the <i>Parallel Lives </i>only in part.&nbsp; Because Plutarch dedicated some of them, including the first pair, to Sosius, his friend in imperial government, he had to have written them before the latter&#x2019;s death sometime before 116 CE; perhaps the series began in honor of Sosius&#x2019;s consulship in 99 CE.&nbsp; Evidence scattered throughout the <i>Parallel Lives </i>indicates that the lives of Epaminondas and Scipio came first (the only pair no longer surviving), the lives of Demosthenes and Cicero came fifth, Pericles and Fabius tenth, and Dion and Brutus twelfth.&nbsp; <i>Caesar</i> refers to <i>Brutus</i> as complete, but <i>Brutus</i> refers to <i>Caesar</i> in the same way.&nbsp; Therefore Plutarch either published these respective pairs together or issued subsequent editions.&nbsp; Similar cross-references elsewhere frustrate an attempt to establish the original sequence.&nbsp; All modern editions arrange the pairs in chronological order of the subjects&#x2019; lives.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the late twentieth century, modern scholars tended to dismiss Plutarch as merely a mine for the earlier sources that he unthinkingly copied into his <i>Lives.</i>&nbsp; He did cite some 150 historians, including about twenty who wrote in Latin.&nbsp; But careful analysis of his work has led to a new appreciation of Plutarch as a literary craftsman, and to a better understanding of the process of literary composition and rhetorical training in antiquity that shows us that Plutarch did not blindly follow some epitome or other.&nbsp; Instead, he depended on extremely broad reading and a highly developed memory in order to assemble the examples that served the ends of a unique project, which was principally moral rather than historical.<b></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In his student days in Athens, Plutarch, like any young man of his time pursuing advanced education, studied rhetoric, science, politics, ethics, and psychology.&nbsp; The immense Plutarchan corpus offers us a vivid glimpse into the character and content of ancient education, which had since the time of Socrates involved a tension or struggle for primacy between style and content, between rhetoric and philosophy, and between word and action.&nbsp; Plutarch lived at the beginning of the intellectual revival known as the Second Sophistic, which privileged rhetorical display above philosophical content.&nbsp; He learned well the techniques of effective rhetoric, and some of the <i>Moralia</i> evidently belong to an early period when he indulged in rhetoric at the expense of truth.&nbsp; Speeches about whether Alexander owed his success to fortune or to his own virtue, for example, exalt Alexander&#x2019;s character and exaggerate his bad luck in order to make the case for virtue.&nbsp; Plutarch clearly benefited from the emphasis of rhetorical training on memory and wide if superficial reading to provide examples to illustrate speeches; over all, his writings include some seven thousand quotations.&nbsp; But in his maturity, Plutarch rejected the rhetorical orientation of the education of his day and subordinated rhetoric to philosophy.&nbsp; Some have unfairly suggested that Plutarch failed as a rhetorician and so remained on the fringe of the Second Sophistic; perhaps we should merely accept Plutarch&#x2019;s argument for the priority of living well over the virtue of dazzling speech.&nbsp;</p><p>In the school of the famous philosopher Ammonius in Athens, Plutarch became a Platonist, but not a rigid one for example, his attitudes toward women, poetry, and sexuality differ markedly from Plato&#x2019;s.&nbsp; He read deeply into all the philosophical traditions of his time: the Platonic Academy, the Aristotelian Peripatetics, the Stoics, and the Epicureans.&nbsp; His personal philosophy emerges clearly in the <i>Moralia,</i> and we may perhaps accurately label him an eclectic with a pronounced Platonic tendency.&nbsp; Not an original thinker, Plutarch nonetheless represents comprehensively the intellectual culture of his age to such an extent that one Plutarch scholar branded him a milch-cow of practical philosophy&#x201d; who browsed on literature and philosophy and yielded rich cream for his readers.&nbsp; He was hostile to the Epicureans on account of their advocacy of withdrawal from public life and to the Stoics on account of their hostility to passion.&nbsp; Plutarch&#x2019;s ethics required a person to seek happiness through right conduct, which included duty to fellow citizens, and which depended not on the eradication of the passions but their control through the power of reason.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Peripatetics taught that character (<i>ethos</i>) consists of its unchanging essential nature (<i>physis</i>) and a variety of qualities that change and develop as a result of education (<i>paideia</i>), philosophy (<i>logos</i>), habitual action, and reaction to events.&nbsp; Character reveals itself through action (<i>praxis</i>) and speech (<i>lexis</i>).&nbsp; So Plutarch writes of Brutus:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>having to the goodness of his disposition added the improvements of learning and the study of philosophy, and having stirred up his natural parts, of themselves grave and gentle, by applying himself to business and public affairs, [he] seems to have been of a temper exactly framed for virtue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The virtues are not static but can develop one can learn excellence.&nbsp; Good education joins with good environment, good habits, good opinion, and good customs in order to strengthen the rational part of the soul and help it to control the irrational, enabling one to lead a life of moderation between excesses and defects.&nbsp; A person fails or succeeds according to the quality of his moral development.&nbsp; Biography gives examples of how to achieve moderation, like case-studies of the interaction of reason and emotion.&nbsp; So in his <i>Lives,</i> Plutarch constantly watches out for the mildness and humanity (<i>philanthropia)</i> of his subjects, their domestic love and friendship.&nbsp; The greatest danger to the moral life comes from flatterers a Cleopatra who would destroy an Antony.&nbsp; Without gentleness and humanity flattery can turn the powerful virtues of otherwise great men such as Marius to violence and brutality. <p>The life of the Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus highlights the importance of good educational institutions.&nbsp; In the comparison of Lycurgus with Numa, whose failure to give Rome a similar system resulted in the collapse of his good work after his death, Plutarch observes:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>no sooner did [Numa] expire his last breath than the gates of Janus's temple flew wide open, and, as if war had, indeed, been kept and caged up within those walls, it rushed forth to fill all Italy with blood and slaughter; and thus that best and justest fabric of things was of no long continuance, because it wanted that cement which should have kept all together, education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plutarch&#x2019;s most explicit statement of his educational program comes in <i>Timoleon</i>:<i></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was for the sake of others that I first commenced writing biographies; but I find myself proceeding and attaching myself to it for my own; the virtues of these great men serving me as a sort of looking-glass, in which I may see how to adjust and adorn my own life. Indeed, it can be compared to nothing but daily living and associating together; we receive, as it were, in our inquiry, and entertain each successive guest, view </p><p>"Their stature and their qualities,"</p><p>and select from their actions all that is noblest and worthiest to know.</p><p>"Ah, and what greater pleasure can one have?"</p><p>or what more effective means to one's moral improvement?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He continues by describing the changes in his soul that biographical study effected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My method, on the contrary, is, by the study of history, and by the familiarity acquired in writing, to habituate my memory to receive and retain images of the best and worthiest characters. I thus am enabled to free myself from any ignoble, base, or vicious impressions, contracted from the contagion of ill company that I may be unavoidably engaged in; by the remedy of turning my thoughts in a happy and calm temper to view these noble examples.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biography proved an ideal mechanism for Plutarch&#x2019;s moral project.&nbsp; As we have seen, he explicitly distinguished history from biography, and so gave morality first place: the biographer describes not so much what the subject did as how he responded to what he experienced, how he controlled his passions.&nbsp; Plutarch chose his subjects not so much because they played decisive roles in history, but rather because they displayed powerful human qualities.&nbsp; This sort of approach has blemished Plutarch&#x2019;s validity for modern readers who expect objectivity and accuracy.&nbsp; Such an approach also leads to a certain one-dimensionality of his subjects, whereby a man becomes typical of a certain virtue or set of virtues and other features of his life appear marginalized.&nbsp; Plutarch&#x2019;s preoccupation with moral instruction means that although he does not change the facts, he does select them with a moral eye and a weighing of evidence toward the likely and seemly rather than toward the demonstrable.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, although Plutarch knew that Croesus ruled a generation after Solon, he disregarded the chronological discrepancy, calling the encounter famous, widely reported, and appropriate to Solon&#x2019;s character.&nbsp; Furthermore, Plutarch judged chronological problems as irreconcilable.&nbsp; Finally, Plutarch&#x2019;s understanding of bias differs great...</p><h2>A Graphical Approach to Algebra and Trigonometry</h2><p><b> <p> <b>Note:&nbsp;</b>You are purchasing a standalone product; MyMathLab does not come packaged with this content.

The short text is easy to understand, yet filled with valuable information for teachers. <br><br>Teachers must constantly make decisions about which teaching method to use at any given point. Complicating the decision-making, however, is the plethora of methods from which teachers may choose, and the fact that proponents of so many different methods claim to have scientific research to support their ideas. Nevertheless, the task of choosing might be a little easier after reading Willis's book. While many texts focus on advising teachers how to implement a specific teaching strategy, Willis focuses on helping teachers understand how the human brain works and how teachers can use that knowledge to choose strategies that tap into the brain's normal processes. <br><br>In just over 100 pages, Willis deals with a wide range of educational issues. For example, she describes how the brain stores information and develops networking connections between related data. This, she writes, can help teachers understand why students sometimes have difficulty learning vocabulary. Unless a student is shown the relationships between existing knowledge and the new vocabulary, the student's brain stores the new information in isolation. Storing information in isolation then makes it more difficult for the brain to retrieve the information later. Conversely, if the student understands the connections between previous knowledge and new knowledge, the brain literally networks the information, which makes it easier for the brain to retrieve the information in the future. Willis describes how teachers can use graphic organizers, visualization, and role-play to help students make those cognitive connections. <br><br>An entire chapter is dedicated to understand how stress affects the brain and how schools and families can work together to reduce stress on students and help students handle the stress they do feel. Another chapter is dedicated to discussing many good assessment techniques. In this context, rather than merely describing how to write rubrics, Willis describes how rubrics help students' brains develop. <br><br>Of course, in describing so many neurological functions, it is necessary for Willis to use intimidating terms, such as dendrites, occipital lobes, and prefrontal cortex. Willis does a remarkable job, however, explaining such terms. And in case the reader forgets what a term means mid-book, the book includes a handy glossary. <br><br>I found Research-Based Strategies to Ignite Student Learning to be a surprisingly understandable, yet treasure-packed resource. And its readability and short length mean one can easily read it over a weekend. <br><br>Best of all, the book could meet the needs of a wide audience. Willis has explained her ideas well enough that preservice teachers could easily understand the material; in fact, I can see this book becoming popular in teacher education programs. At the same time, the book offers such a unique perspective and valuable information that even veteran teachers are likely to benefit from investing their time in reading it.Judy Willis is a board-certified neurologist and middle school teacher in Santa Barbara, California.

But how was the vast territory of the empire controlled? Did the demands of central government stimulate economic growth, or endanger survival? What forces of cohesion operated to balance the social and economic inequalities and high mortality rates? Why did Roman governments freeze the official religion while allowing the diffusion of alien, especially oriental, cults? Are we to see in their attitude to Christianity a policy of toleration&#x2014;or simply confusion and a failure of nerve?<br><br>These are some of the many questions posed in this book, which offers the first overall account of the society, economy and culture of the Roman empire.

This acclaimed book, now in a new edition, offers both a comprehensive discussion of the dynamics of Greek obscenity and a detailed commentary on the terminology itself. <br><br> After contrasting the peculiar characteristics of the Greek notion of obscenity to modern-day ideas, Henderson discusses obscenity's role in the development of Attic Comedy, its historical origins, varieties, and dramatic function. His analysis of obscene terminology sheds new light on Greek culture, and his discussion of Greek homosexuality offers a refreshing corrective to the idealized Platonic view. He also looks in detail at the part obscenity plays in each of Aristophanes' eleven surviving plays. The latter part of the book identifies all the obscene terminology found in the extant examples of Attic Comedy, both complete plays and fragments. Although these terminological entries are arranged in numbered paragraphs resembling a glossary, they can also be read as independent essays on the various aspects of comic obscenity. Terms are explained as they occur in each individual context and in relation to typologically similar terminology. With newly corrected and updated philological material, this second edition of <em>Maculate Muse</em> will serve as an invaluable reference work for the study of Greek drama.</p><p>Jeffrey Henderson is at University of Southern California.<br><em>Praise for the First Edition</em>: "An important, sound, scholarly contribution to our understanding of obscenity not only in Athenian culture generally, but especially as it is integral to the themes of ancient comic plays....This study breaks new ground and will have wide appeal."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"For the first time in the history of scholarship on Greek Old Comedy in general and on Aristophanes in particular we have in Henderson's [book] a comprehensive study of the obscenity which is so prominent a feature of Old Comedy, and his discussions will be welcomed by all interested in this aspect of it....A major contribution."--<em>The Classical Journal</em><p></p><br>"This thorough collection will be of great use to students of Aristophanes."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"A most valuable instrument of study, for which we must be heartily grateful."--<em>Classical Philology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Spanish Level One</h2><p>Listeners learn pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar of a new language without the need of a textbook.

The book chronicles the launching of the park project, the disputes surrounding its design and management, the job of constructing it, and the various ways it has served generations of New Yorkers. Throughout, the authors delineate the politicians, business people, artists, immigrant laborers, and city dwellers who are the key players in the tale. In tracing the park&#39;s history, the writers also give us the history of New York. They explain how squabbles over politics, taxes, and real estate development shaped the park and describe the acrimonious debates over what a public park should look like, what facilities it should offer, and how it should accommodate the often incompatible expectations of different groups of parkgoers. The authors have uncovered surprising information about the immigrants and African Americans who were displaced from the park site, and they offer a critical reassessment of the famous collaboration of the park&#39;s designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. In rich detail, they describe working-class New Yorkers fighting for Sunday park concerts and against the practice of renting park seats for a nickel. They look back at the origins of the zoo and museums at the park&#39;s borders. They follow the battle between the twentieth-century reformers who wanted to introduce playgrounds and ball fields and the preservationists trying to protect the original Olmsted and Vaux design, and they explain the dramatic changes broughtabout by the social impulses of the New Deal and by Robert Moses. Rounding out the story, the authors take in the park&#39;s recent history: rising fears of crime in the 1950s, the &#34;be-ins&#34; and anti-war demonstrations of the 1960s, the devastating fiscal crisis of the 1970s, and the restoration of the park in the 1980s by the Central Park Conservancy. But the authors&#39; aim is much wider: they also show that conflicting visions of how a park should be managed and used raise larger issues about the meaning of the &#34;public&#34; in a democratic society. Who is the public? How can people take part in making decisions about public institutions? How do we create public space where people of diverse social and cultural backgrounds will feel welcome? These are questions that communities across the nation will continue to debate. Parkgoers and city dwellers everywhere will be enthusiastic readers of The Park and the People, as will those interested in urban, architectural, social, and cultural history, urban planning, and landscape architecture.What took 166 tons of dynamite, six million bricks, 19,000 cubic yards of sand, 20,000 men, and $5 million to build? If you answered New York's Central Park, give yourself a perfect grade. The same is awarded this magnificent public works history, a masterpiece combining the story of the park, the history of New York, city and state politics, and the people of the city. Central Park was conceived in the 1840s, built in the depression era of 1857, and renovated during the Great Depression. The authors have exhausted primary and secondary sources to produce this definitive work, which surpasses an earlier photographic history, Circle of Seasons . From the work of park designers Frederic Law Olmsted and Calbert Vaux to New Deal park commissioner Robert Moses to the administration of Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, the volume is a rare combination of scholarship and readable text. The emphasis is on the 19th century and the park's formative decades, including design, property acquisition, and the men whose labor created the world's best-known park. Ignoring neither the vested interests of the propertied class who stood to benefit from the park nor the fear of crime in Central Park, Rosenzweig and Blackmar produce a model history--not just of the park but of the city and people who turn to it for amusement, recreation, relaxation, and more.<br><i>-Boyd Childress, Auburn Univ.

It is designed for students who have an intermediate- or advanced-level command of the French language. It assumes an interest in French culture on the part of the reader, but no previous knowledge of it. </p> <p> The basic structure and approach of the 1970 and 1995 editions have been kept. The text As been updated. A chapter on the European Union has been added. Some illustrations are new. A selection of useful "gateway" web sites has also been added. Statistical data have been kept to a minimum as they become quickly outdated and often do not mean much to students, especially if no corresponding data from their own country are supplied. Unless specified, statistical data included in this book were drawn from <i>Quid 2000</i> and <i>Fancoscopie 1999.</i> A set of questionnaires and suggestions for assignments is provided for each chapter at the end of the book; instructors may use them as needed. </p> <p> Many textbooks on French culture put excessive emphasis on the present, assuming that only <i>l'actualit�</i> will elicit students' interest. <i>Les Francais</i> does not follow that path. We believe that focusing exclusively on present-day France prevents students from truly understanding it. Adults who live in France today were not educated in French schools in 2000, but in 1930, 1950, 1970, or 1990. To understand what made them who they are, it is more illuminating to look at school textbooks of 10 or 20 years ago than at today's textbooks. In order to provide a depth of perspective, we have given much attention to the historical roots of French behavior and institutions as well as to the sweeping changes that have taken place within French society during the last four decades. Many textbooks on French culture also fail to provide a comparative outlook, making it difficult for students to see where France and the French stand in relation to their own country and to themselves. This new edition, as the previous ones, emphasizes comparisons between French and American cultures. </p> <p> <i>Jean-Franfois Bri�re</i> </p> <p><b>Preface to the 1995 edition</b></p> <p> When I was growing up in southern Indiana in the 1920s, we lived in one small town after another because my father was a Methodist minister. We assumed that since we had the habit of living in different groups of people we would be able to get along with all kinds of people anywhere we might live. Then in 1929 I left Indiana University to spend a year in France. What a revelation it was to live in the midst of a people who behaved so differently and thought so differently from the folks back home in Indiana! </p> <p> Then when I graduated in 1931 and had to get a job to support myself, I found there were no jobs to be had! We were in the midst of The Great Depression. Unexpectedly the Romance Languages Department at Indiana had a vacancy and offered me the job teaching Beginning French for five hours a week at $1,000 a semester if I started working for an M.A. at the same time. I eagerly accepted. Why not? I had never thought I would be a teacher, but after I began to teach I discovered I really enjoyed the experience. So I have spent the rest of my life teaching. </p> <p> But then gradually as I became used to this profession I realized I was not so interested in studying and teaching language itself as in helping people understand other people of different cultures get along together. Then finally I discovered that my own experience in France helped me. I began to ask myself why I had found that the French people act so differently from the folks I had considered normal people back in southern Indiana? In fact, by that time I lived in New England and began to ask the same question about the difference between Hoosiers and New Englanders! Indeed my aunt in Paoli, Indiana, asked me: "Laurence, why do you talk so queer now?" While in Boston people would ask me, "What part of the south do you come from?" It was not just a question of my accent. </p> <p> My main problem in teaching was in trying to help students get over the discomfort of being in a French class and asked to read a textbook on French Civilization. The truth was that I, too, was bored by whatever textbooks I found. There was just something about books on "French Civilization" that turned me off. I too, could not get excited about French geography, history and art, which were the basic subjects of these books. </p> <p> I felt frustrated also because Americans often asked me about little events that happened to them in involvements with French people. For instance, a friend here in Cambridge asked me about an incident involving a French family in a town near Gren0le where she had sent her daughter for the summer. The daughter was there only a few days when our friend received a cable from the French woman saying she could no longer keep the American girl. She had sent her off to stay with friends in Switzerland for the rest of the summer. It was all a mystery to the American family. They had heard I was going to France soon. Could I find out what this was all about? I arrived in France the next week and right away I phoned the French woman. She replied very calmly that the American girl was so badly brought up that she was setting an unacceptable example for her own children. "What did she do that offended you?" I asked. I was told that every morning when she got awake she took a shower and washed her hair. Then she would walk through the house scantily dressed, still brushing her hair. She would go to the kitchen without getting dressed, take whatever she wanted from the refrigerator, carry it upstairs to her room and eat all alone. Now, I must agree With her, didn't I, that no one like that could live in a well-behaved family? I tried to get out of this by saying that although this behavior might seem a bit extreme, it was not so unusual for a well-brought-up American girl. Now this type of incident is often the cause of cultural misunderstanding, and it does not help an American to know about geography, history, and art! </p> <p> An unexpected event brought me indirectly a better understanding of my problem. An anthropologist, Ashley Montagu, came to Haverford College, where I was teaching by that time, and gave a public lecture on modern "cultural anthropology" which I attended. I was amazed. When I had been in college, anthropology was known only for its studies in archeology and geological history&#x2014;nicknamed derisively by students as the study of "stones and bones:" But there was now a newly emphasized sort of anthropology, cultural anthropology, a study mainly of family life and childhood. The word "culture" was used to refer to the whole pattern of living of any group of people anywhere. </p> <p> Montagu's point in his lecture was that a human being could not live without, unconsciously at least, forming a conception about three phenomena: the nature of time, the nature of the space around us, and the human nature of living beings. These conceptions differ from one culture to another, and we can have no fundamental understanding of a culture unless we know what are the basic beliefs of the people formed in childhood in these cultures and how these differ from those of other cultures. The analysis of these problems was the basis of the new anthropological studies of scholars like Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict that had become so important. The importance of child training is so overwhelming in the formation of character that the whole character of people in a culture is based on it. So the purpose of studying the geography of a culture is to learn not the basic facts of geography but people's conception of space and their activity relating to it. And the best way to comprehend how a culture is formed is to live among a people and study the way children are brought up and form these conceptions. </p> <p> After listening to this lecture and reflecting on its relation to my personal and professional problems, I read several studies by the anthropologists he mentioned and others. I decided my plan should be to study cultural anthropology and then try to undertake a cultural study (in the anthropological sense) in France, but meanwhile I needed to learn more about the theoretical structure involved. A handy electric trolley could take me into Philadelphia easily, so I attended cultural anthropological courses of A. Irving Hallowell at Penn U., without its preventing me from doing my usual teaching. As a matter of fact I was feeding a bit of my learning back into the courses I taught. </p> <p> After two years of study I decided to try to put what I had learned to use in advancing to a new stage: I would take my wife and two little boys (ages two and four to live in a village where I could observe how average French people lived and raised families. The problem was finding money to carry out the plan. It was a difficult problem because foundations, which provide funds for such research, are largely run by professional organizations, and professions are parochial about the use of funds: Foundations governing the funds for research in the humanities do not like to distribute them for use in social sciences; foundations governing funds for the social sciences do not like to provide them for a scholar with a Ph.D. in language and literature. Finally the Social Science Research Council was persuaded to grant me the money to pay for a year's residence in a southern French village. So I spent the next few years living in Roussillon, taking copious notes, then writing about my research and getting the book published. My next sabbatic leave we spent in a very different kind of village, Chanzeaux. </p><p> </p><p> Meanwhile the new book about Roussillon, <i>Village in the Vaucluse,</i> was more successful than I had dared hope. But now I faced a new problem: What university would provide room for me to teach a social science course in a language and literature department? I needed to work on a course where I could teach an understanding of French behavior as I had explored it. But then came a big moment in my life. One morning my phone rang and a voice said, "This is McGeorge Bundy, dean of the college at Harvard. We were wondering if you would come to teach in the new Dillon Chair of French Civilization ...." Later I learned that this new chair founded by the Dillon family was beyond control of a traditional department. I was to be in the Social Relations Department, a new interdepartmental department! Dean Bundy had aided in its foundation because he liked to sponsor new features in university life. I loved Haverford, but the new opportunity was too good. We moved to Harvard, and I spent the rest of my career teaching there. I taught a seminar on French village organization and gave a lecture course in General Education on French Civilization. </p> <p> My big course was the lecture course and it was right away quite popular. Publishers became interested in publishing a textbook for courses on French Civilization. Dr. Garcia-Gir�n of Prentice Hall insisted on my writing one. I said I was going off to France to serve as Cultural Officer at the US. Embassy and could not write it for the next two years. Garcia-Gir�n then proposed that we have my lectures of that very year taped and typed. This was done, and then he persuaded Professors Armand and Louise B�gu#&amp;233;, of Brooklyn College, to translate the manuscript and edit the book, providing vocabulary, questions, etc., for use by students of French in this country. The book, <i>Les Franfais,</i> appeared in 1970 and has been successful for years. Now, <i>h�las,</i> the B#&amp;233;gu�s have both disappeared, I am sad to say. And the book is dated! </p> <p> However, I am extremely lucky to see Jean-Francois Briere, Associate Professor of French Studies at the State University of New York at Albany, perpetuate the book by rewriting and modernizing it. It has been wonderful working with him: He was born and educated in France and, as a member of the generation after mine, he is more acquainted with a more recent France. He also knows the United States, since he is married to an American woman and teaches Americans. He writes about both cultures with V sound grasp of all he speaks. At the same time he uses what I have written when it is pertinent, and he utilizes my structure which I learned from cultural anthropologists. I am proud to share this book with him and to have my name listed alongside his. I predict that this book will be a leading textbook for the next twenty-five years, and I hope he then finds a collaborator worthy of him to continue the work in the future. </p> <p> <i>Lawrence Wylie</i> <br> (1909-1995) </p> <p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p> <p> The author would like to thank the following reviewers for their participation in the revision process and for their many helpful comments and suggestions: </p> <p> Marie Ponterio, <i>SUNY College at Cortland;</i> Mary Ekman, <i>SUNY New Paltz;</i> Edward Knox, Middlebury College; Michele Bissiere, <i>University of North Carolina, Charlotte;</i> Raymond Eichmann, <i>University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.</i> </p></p><h2>Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now</h2><p><b>&#x201c;If the end of the twentieth century can be characterized by futurism, the twenty-first can be defined by presentism.&#x201d;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>This is the moment we&#x2019;ve been waiting for, explains award-winning media theorist Douglas Rushkoff, but we don&#x2019;t seem to have any time in which to live it.

And the dissonance between our digital selves and our analog bodies has thrown us into a new state of anxiety: present shock.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rushkoff weaves together seemingly disparate events and trends into a rich, nuanced portrait of how life in the eter�nal present has affected our biology, behavior, politics, and culture. He explains how the rise of zombie apocalypse fic�tion signals our intense desire for an ending; how the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street form two sides of the same post-narrative coin; how corporate investing in the future has been replaced by futile efforts to game the stock market in real time; why social networks make people anxious and email can feel like an assault. He examines how the tragedy of 9/11 disconnected an entire generation from a sense of history, and delves into why conspiracy theories actually comfort us.<br>&nbsp;<br>As both individuals and communities, we have a choice. We can struggle through the onslaught of information and play an eternal game of catch-up.

Here we are.</p><p>If the end of the twentieth century can be characterized by futurism, the twenty- first can be defined by presentism.</p><p>The looking forward so prevalent in the late 1990s was bound to end once the new millennium began. Like some others of that era, I predicted a new focus on the moment, on real experience, and on what things are actually worth right now. Then 9/ 11 magnified this sensibility, forcing America as a nation to contend with its own impermanence. People had babies in droves, and even fi led for divorces, in what was at least an unconscious awareness that none of us lives forever and an accompanying reluctance to postpone things indefinitely. Add real- time technologies, from the iPhone to Twitter; a disposable consumer economy where 1-Click ordering is more important than the actual product being purchased; a multitasking brain actually incapable of storage or sustained argument; and an economy based on spending now what one may or may not earn in a lifetime, and you can&#x2019;t help but become temporally disoriented. It&#x2019;s akin to the onslaught of changing rules and circumstances that 1970s futurist Alvin Toffler dubbed &#x201c;future shock.&#x201d;</p><p>Only, in our era it&#x2019;s more of a <i>present shock</i>. And while this phenomenon is clearly &#x201c;of the moment,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s not quite as in the moment as we may have expected. For while many of us were correct about the way all this presentism would affect investments and finance, even technology and media, we were utterly wrong about how living in the &#x201c;now&#x201d; would end up impacting us as people. Our focus on the present may have liberated us from the twentieth century&#x2019;s dangerously compelling ideological narratives. No one&#x2014; well, hardly anyone&#x2014; can still be convinced that brutal means are justified by mythological ends. And people are less likely to believe employers&#x2019; and corporations&#x2019; false promises of future rewards for years of loyalty now. But it has not actually brought us into greater awareness of what is going on around us. We are not approaching some Zen state of an infinite moment, completely at one with our surroundings, connected to others, and aware of ourselves on any fundamental level.</p><p>Rather, we tend to exist in a distracted present, where forces on the periphery are magnified and those immediately before us are ignored. Our ability to create a plan&#x2014; much less follow through on it&#x2014; is undermined by our need to be able to improvise our way through any number of external impacts that stand to derail us at any moment. Instead of finding a stable foothold in the here and now, we end up reacting to the ever- present assault of simultaneous impulses and commands.</p><p>In some senses, this was the goal of those who developed the computers and networks on which we depend today. Mid- twentieth century computing visionaries Vannevar Bush and J. C. R. Licklider dreamed of developing machines that could do our remembering for us. Computers would free us from the tyranny of the past&#x2014; as well as the horrors of World War II&#x2014; allowing us to forget everything and devote our minds to solving the problems of today. The information would still be there; it would simply be stored out of body, in a machine.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a tribute to both their designs on the future and their devotion to the past that they succeeded in their quest to free up the present of the burden of memory. We have, in a sense, been allowed to dedicate much more of our cognitive resources to active RAM than to maintaining our cerebral- storage hard drives. But we are also in danger of squandering this cognitive surplus on the trivial pursuit of the immediately relevant over any continuance of the innovation that got us to this point.</p><p>Behavioral economists exploit the growing disparity between our understanding of the present and that of the future, helping us see future debts as less relevant than current costs and leading us to make financial decisions against our own better interests. As these ways of understanding debt and lending trickle up to those making decisions about banking and macro finance&#x2014; such as the Federal</p><p>Reserve or the European Central Bank&#x2014; our greater economies end up suffering from the same sorts of logical traps as those of individual mortgage holders and credit card users.</p><p>Neuroscientists, mostly at the service of corporations looking to develop more compliant employees and consumers, are homing in on the way people make choices. But no matter how many subjects they put in their MRI machines, the focus of this research is decision making in the moment, the impulsive choices made in the blink of an eye, rather than those made by the lobes responsible for rational thought or consideration. By implementing their wares solely on the impulsive&#x2014; while diminishing or altogether disregarding the considered&#x2014; they push us toward acting in what is thought of as an instinctual, reptilian fashion.</p><p>And this mode of behavior is then justified as somehow more connected to the organic, emotional, and immediately relevant moment in which human beings actually live. Of course, this depiction of consciousness may help sell the services of neurotechnicians to advertisers, but it does not accurately represent how the human brain relates to the moment in which the organism exists.</p><p>No matter how invasive the technologies at their disposal, marketers and pollsters never come to terms with the living process through which people choose products or candidates; they are looking at what people just bought or thought, and making calculations based on that after- the- fact data. The &#x201c;now&#x201d; they seek to understand tells them nothing about desire, reasons, or context. It is simply an effort to key off what we have just done in order to manipulate our decisions in the future. Their campaigns encourage the kinds of impulsive behavior that fool us into thinking we are living in the now while actually just making us better targets for their techniques.</p><p>That is because there is no <i>now</i>&#x2014;not the one they&#x2019;re talking about, anyway. It is necessarily and essentially trivial. The minute the &#x201c;now&#x201d; is apprehended, it has already passed. Like they used to say about getting one&#x2019;s picture on a <i>Time</i> magazine cover: the moment something is realized, it is over. And like the diminishing beauty returns for a facially paralyzed Botox addict, the more forcefully we attempt to stop the passage of time, the less available we are to the very moment we seek to preserve.</p><p>As a result, our culture becomes an entropic, static hum of everybody trying to capture the slipping moment. Narrativity and goals are surrendered to a skewed notion of the real and the immediate; the Tweet; the status update. What we are doing at any given moment becomes all- important&#x2014; which is behavioristically doomed. For this desperate approach to time is at once fl awed and narcissistic. Which &#x201c;now&#x201d; is important: the now I just lived or the now I&#x2019;m in right now? In the following chapters, we will explore present shock as it manifests in a variety of ways, on a myriad of levels. We will look at how it changes the way we make and experience culture, run our businesses, invest our money, conduct our politics, understand science, and make sense of our world. In doing so, we will consider panic reactions to present shock right alongside more successful approaches to living outside what we have always thought of as time.</p><p>The book is divided into fi ve sections, corresponding to the fi ve main ways that present shock manifests for us. We begin with the collapse of narrative. How do we tell stories and convey values without the time required to tell a linear story? How does pop culture continue to function without traditional storylines, and how does politics communicate without grand narratives? We move on to &#x201c;Digiphrenia&#x201d;&#x2014;the way our media and technologies encourage us to be in more than one place at the same time. We&#x2019;ll see that our relationship to time has always been defined by the technologies we use to measure it, and that digital time presents particular challenges we haven&#x2019;t had to contend with before. In &#x201c;Overwinding,&#x201d; we look at the effort to squish really big timescales into much smaller ones. It&#x2019;s the effort to make the passing moment responsible for the sorts of effects that actually take real time to occur. In particular, what does this do to business and finance, which are relying on increasingly derivative forms of investment? Next we look at what happens when we try to make sense of our world entirely in the present tense. Without a timeline through which to parse causes and effects, we instead attempt to draw connections from one thing to another in the frozen moment, even when such connections are forced or imaginary. It&#x2019;s a desperate grasp for real- time pattern recognition I&#x2019;ll call &#x201c;Fractalnoia.&#x201d; Finally, we face &#x201c;Apocalypto&#x201d;&#x2014;the way a seemingly infinite present makes us long for endings, by almost any means necessary.</p><p>We will encounter drone pilots contending with the stress of dropping bombs on a distant war zone by remote control before driving home to the suburbs for supper an hour later. We will see the way the physical real estate of Manhattan is being optimized for the functioning of the ultrafast trading algorithms now running the stock market&#x2014; as well as what this means for the human traders left in the wake. We will encounter doomsday &#x201c;preppers&#x201d; who stock up on silver coins and ready-to-eat meals while dismissing climate change as a conspiracy theory hatched by Al Gore and since exposed in an email scandal. 3 We will consider the &#x201c;singularity&#x201d;&#x2014;as well as our scientific community&#x2019;s response to present shock&#x2014; especially for the ways it mirrors the religious extremism accompanying other great social shifts throughout history.</p><p>Most important, we will consider what we human beings can do to pace ourselves and our expectations when there&#x2019;s no temporal backdrop against which to measure our progress, no narrative through which to make sense of our actions, no future toward which we may strive, and seemingly no time to figure any of this out.</p><p>I suggest we intervene on our own behalf&#x2014; and that we do it right now, in the present moment. When things begin accelerating wildly out of control, sometimes patience is the only answer. Press pause.</p><p>We have time for this.</p></p><h2>Pronouncing American English: Sounds, Stress, and Intonation</h2><p>Newly updated, this classic text continues to be the most comprehensive overview of the American sound system.

The second edition&#x2019;s refreshed presentation includes extensive new visuals, as well as updated exercises throughout. <br></p><p>This book strikes a balance between the traditional and the modern combining the traditional material with a modern systems emphasis. Chapter topics cover an introduction to differential equations, first-order equations, modeling and applications, second-order equations, the Laplace Transform, numerical methods, matrix algebra, an introduction to systems, linear systems with constant coefficients, nonlinear systems, power series solutions, Fourier series methods, and partial differential equations.<p> This book started in 1993, when the first author began to reorganize the teaching of ODEs at Rice University. It soon became apparent that a textbook was needed that brought to the students the expanded outlook that modern developments in the subject required, and the use of technology allowed. Over the ensuing years this book has evolved. </p> <p> The mathematical subject matter of this book has not changed dramatically from that of many books published ten or even twenty years ago. The book strikes a balance between the traditional and the modern. It covers all of the traditional material and somewhat more. It does so in a way that makes it easily possible, but not necessary, to use modern technology, especially for the visualization of the ideas involved in ordinary differential equations. It offers flexibility of use that will allow instructors at a variety of institutions to use the book. In fact, this book could easily be used in a traditional differential equations course, provided the instructor carefully chooses the exercises assigned. However, there are changes in our students, in our world, and in our mathematics that require some changes in the ODE course, and the way we teach it. </p> <p> Our students are now as likely to be majoring in the biological sciences or economics as in the physical sciences or engineering. These students are more interested in systems of equations than they are in second-order equations. They are also more interested in applications to their own areas rather than to physics or engineering. </p> <p> Our world is increasingly a technological world. In academia we are struggling with the problem of adapting to this new world. The easiest way to start a spirited discussion in a group of faculty is to raise the subject of the use of technology in our teaching. Regardless of one's position on this subject, it is widely agreed that the course where the use of technology makes the most sense, and where the impact of computer visualization is the most beneficial, is in the study of ODEs. The use of computer visualization pervades this book. The degree to which the student and the instructor are involved is up to the instructor. </p> <p> The subject of ordinary differential equations has progressed, as has all of mathematics. To many it is now known by the new name, dynamical systems. Much of the progress, and many of the directions in which the research has gone, have been motivated by computer experiments. Much of the work is qualitative in nature. This is beautiful mathematics. Introducing some of these ideas to students at an early point is a move in the right direction. It gives them a better idea of what mathematics is about than the standard way of discussing one solution method after another. It should be emphasized that the introduction of qualitative methods is not, in itself, a move to less rigor. </p> <p><b>The Use of Technology</b></p> <p> The book covers the standard material with an appropriate level of rigor. However, it enables the instructor to be flexible in the use of modern technology. Available to all, without the use of any technology, is the large number of graphics in the book that display the ideas in ODEs. At the next level are a large number of exercises that require the student to compute and plot solutions. For these exercises, the student will have to have access to computer (or calculator) programs that will do this easily. </p> <p> The tools needed for most of these exercises are two. The student will need a program that will plot the direction field for a single differential equation, and superimpose the solution with given initial conditions. In addition, the student will need a program that will plot the vector field for an autonomous planar system of equations, and superimpose the solution with given initial conditions. Such tools are available in MATLAB, Maple, and Mathematica. For many purposes it will be useful for the students to have computer (or calculator) tools for graphing functions of a single variable. </p> <p> The book can also be used to teach a course in which the students learn numerical methods early and are required to use them regularly throughout the course. Students in such a course learn the valuable skill of solving equations and systems of equations numerically and interpreting the results using the subject matter of the course. The treatment of numerical methods is somewhat more substantial than in other books. However, just enough is covered so that readers get a sense of the complexity involved. Computational error is treated, but not so rigorously as to bog the reader down and interrupt the flow of the text. Students are encouraged to do some experimental analysis of computational error. </p> <p><b>Modeling and Applications</b></p> <p> It is becoming a common feature of mathematics books to include a large list of applications. Usually the students are presented with the mathematical model and they are required to apply it to a variety of cases. The derivation of the model is not done. There is some sense in this. After all, mathematics does not include all of the many application areas, and the derivation of the models is the subject of the application areas. Furthermore, the derivations are very time consuming. </p> <p> However, mathematicians and mathematics are part of the modeling process. It should be a greater part of our teaching. This book takes a novel approach to the teaching of modeling. While a large number of applications are covered as examples, in some cases the applications are covered in more detail than is usual. There is a historical study of the models of motion, which demonstrates to students how models continue to evolve as knowledge increases. There is an in-depth study of several population models, including their derivation. Included are historical examples of how such models were applied both where they were appropriate and where they were not. This demonstrates to students that it is necessary to understand the assumptions that lie behind a model before using them, and that any model must be checked by experiments or observations before it is accepted. </p> <p> In addition, models in personal finance are discussed. This is an area of potential interest to all students, but not one that is covered in any detail in college courses. Students majoring in almost all disciplines approach these problems on an even footing. As a result it is an area where students can be required to do some modeling on their own. </p> <p><b>Linear Algebra and Systems</b></p> <p> Most books at this level assume that students have an understanding of elementary matrix algebra, usually in two and three dimensions. In the experience of the authors this assumption is not valid. Accordingly, this book devotes a chapter to matrix algebra. The topics covered are carefully chosen to be those needed in the study of linear systems of ODEs. With this chapter behind them, the instructor can cover linear systems of ODEs in a more substantive way. On the other hand an instructor who is confident in the knowledge of the students can skip the matrix algebra chapter. </p> <p><b>Projects</b></p> <p> There are a number of projects discussed in the book. These involve students in an in-depth study of either mathematics or an application that uses ODEs. The projects provide students with the opportunity to bring together much of what they have learned, including analytical, computational, and interpretative skills. The level of difficulty of the projects varies. More projects will be made available to users of this book as they are developed. </p> <p><b>Varied Approaches Possible</b></p> <p> It should be noticed that the book has three authors from three very different schools. The ODE courses at these institutions are quite different. Indeed, there is no standard ODE course across the country. The authors set the understandable goal of writing a book that could be used in the ODE courses at each of their own institutions. Meeting this goal required some compromises, but the result is a book that is flexible enough to allow its use in a variety of courses at a variety of institutions. </p> <p> On one hand, it is possible to use the book and teach a more or less standard course. The standard material is covered in the standard order, with or without the use of technology. </p> <p> However, at Rice University, after the first three chapters the class moves to numerical methods, and then to matrix algebra. This is followed by linear systems. Once this material is covered, higher-order equations, including the second-order equations that are important in science and engineering, are covered as examples of systems. This approach allows the students to use linear algebra throughout the course, thereby gaining a working knowledge of the subject. Technology is used throughout to enhance the students' understanding of the mathematical ideas. </p> <p> In another approach, used at College of the Redwoods, the chapter on numerical methods is done early, while discussing the qualitative analysis of single first-order equations. The students are taught the analytical, qualitative, and numerical approaches before moving on to Chapter 3. The chapter on matrix algebra is covered next. There follows an introduction of systems, both linear and nonlinear. Next, they return to second-order equations, including undetermined coefficients, the driven, damped oscillator, resonance, and so forth. The course ends with more on nonlinear systems. The ultimate goal is to get the students to use nullcline analysis and the Jacobian approximation to sketch a phase portrait without the use of software. </p> <p><b>Mathematical Rigor</b></p> <p> Mathematical ideas are not dodged. Proofs are given when the proof will add to the students' understanding of the material. Difficult proofs, or those that do not add to a student's understanding, are avoided. Suggestions of how to proceed, and examples that use these suggestions, are usually offered as motivation before one has to wade through the abstraction of a proof. The authors believe that proof is fundamental to mathematics, and that students at this level should be introduced gently to proof as an integral part of their training in mathematics. This is true for the future engineer or doctor as well as for the math major. </p> <p><b>Additional Material</b></p> <p> The last three chapters of this version contain the solution of boundary value problems and the material needed for that. Chapter 11 is a fairly standard treatment of series solutions. In Chapter 12 we treat Fourier series. This is an expanded version of what appears in most books, including complex Fourier series and the discrete Fourier transform. Since this material is becoming of greater interest, some instructors might want to include it in their courses. In the final chapter, we treat boundary value problems. The way this material is taught is changing, and we have tried to make the treatment a little more modern, while not abandoning the traditional approach. We have added material on the d'Alembert solution to the wave equation, and put some emphasis on the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian, and its importance in understanding the wave and heat equations in more than one space dimension. </p> <p><b>Supplements</b></p> <p> Instructors who use this book will have available a number of resources. There are an Instructor's Solution Manual, containing the complete solutions to all of the exercises, and a Student's Solution Manual with the solutions to the odd-numbered exercises. </p> <p> One way to meet the software needs of the student is to use the programs dfield and pplane, written by the first author for use with MATLAB. These programs are described in the book <i>Ordinary Differential Equations Using MATLAB</i> (ISBN 0-13-011381-6), written by two of the authors of this book. That book is available shrink-wrapped with this one at no extra cost (ISBN 0-13-079497-X). However, it should be emphasized that it is not necessary to use dfield and pplane with this book. There are many other possibilities. </p> <p> The Web site <b>http://www.prenhall.com/polking</b> is a resource that will ultimately become very valuable to both instructors and students. Interactive java versions of the direction field program dfield and the phase plane program pplane will be accessible from this site. It will also provide animations of the examples in the book, links to other Web resources involving differential equations, and true-false quizzes on the subject matter. As additional projects are developed for use with the book, they will be accessible from the Web site. </p></p><h2>Inspiring Spaces for Young Children</h2><p><p>The classroom environment is an essential component for maximizing learning experiences for young children.&nbsp;<i>Inspiring Spaces for Young Children </i>invites teachers to enhance children&#x2019;s educational environment in a beautiful way by emphasizing aesthetic environmental qualities that are often overlooked in early childhood classrooms, such as nature, color, furnishings, textures, displays, lighting, and focal points.&nbsp;</p><p>Step-by-step instructions and lush photographs take educators through the process of transforming ordinary classrooms into creative, beautiful learning spaces, providing children with an environment where they can learn and grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With easy-to-implement ideas that incorporate nature, children&#x2019;s artwork, and everyday classroom materials, the photographs and ideas in this book promote creativity, learning, and simple beauty.</p></p><p>Jessica DeViney has been an employee of Children&#x2019;s Discovery Center since 1993 and is currently the Vice President of Marketing.

Agility Training makes clear all aspects of this, the world's fastest growing and most versatile dog sport. Whatever your interest, whether purely casual or highly competitive, you will find the instructional methods and helpful hints meaningful for your goals.<br><br>Agility Training tells readers how to get started in the sport, work on their own, attend classes, earn titles and organize a competition or practice event. Chapters describe training for all levels of Agility, from beginners through an advanced curriculum. A special feature provides detailed construction plans as well as a list of materials for all obstacles.<br>A Howell Dog Book of Distinction</p><p>Jane Simmons-Moake is a veteran Agility competitor and a judge of Agility events. She and her husband, Gordon Simmons-Moake, are partners in the FlashPaws Agility Training Center in Houston and have been instrumental in organizing Agility events nationwide."Simply put, Agility is the most fun you can share with your dog," the author asserts, and those who have jumped on the bandwagon for this fast-growing sport will enthusiastically agree. Racing against the clock, dogs must, among many challenging obstacles, clear a series of hurdles, dash through tunnels and up and down see-saws, and weave in and out of a line of closely spaced poles. Simmons-Moake provides a solid introduction to the sport, while husband Gordon's detailed appendix on obstacle construction is extremely useful to those just starting out. Public libraries, especially those serving communities with active dog obedience clubs, should consider. Areas with established agility clubs will prefer Julie Daniels's Enjoying Dog Agility (Doral, 1991), which offers excellent step-by-step training instructions (including puppy training and agility for children) as well as creative ideas for obstacles; it refers readers to the U.S. Dog Agility Association for information on obstacle construction.

It is very thorough in its presentation of plants as organisms, discussing the different types of plants (annuals, biennials, and perennials and various examples of each, bacteria and fungi), The book discusses the many ways that plants reproduce, a discussion of seeds and fruit, and the parts and components of plants, from the cellular level to their structure. Beautiful illustrations by Paul Wenck are contained throughout the text. Some basic experiments are included. An index is provided. This book was originally intended for upper elementary grades but because of its broad coverage of the material, would be valuable reading for upper grade levels as well.</p></p><p></p><h2>Isaiah 1-39: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (Anchor Bible)</h2><p><p>Writing a commentary on the book of Isaiah in the middle of a paradigm shift in biblical studies, and in the study of the prophetic books in particular, is no easy task. The book of Isaiah has been the object of more scholarly interest over the past two or three decades than during the preceding century. At the same time, much of the received wisdom on the formation of the book has been called into question, including such matters as the date of its several components, the standard tripartite division, the role (if any) to be assigned to the prophet Isaiah himself, and the passages dealing with the anonymous Servant of the Lord. A great deal of effort has been, and continues to be, expended in exploring new approaches to the book, both within the conventional critical methodologies and beyond them.<br>This commentary by Joseph Blenkinsopp on the first thirty-nine chapters of the book, the first of a three-volume commentary on Isaiah, is written from a critical perspective in the belief that only in this way can these texts be given the opportunity to say what they have to say�&#x20ac;&#x201d;and also in the conviction that what they have to say still retains its transforming power for those willing to listen attentively today. The result is a commentary of unequaled brilliance and insight that will stand as the definitive study of one of the Hebrew Bible�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s most compelling and elusive books.</p></p><p><p><b>JOSEPH BLENKINSOPP</b> is currently John A.

World-weary and self-destructive, Pechorin is yet is full of passion and romantic ardor, sensitive as well as arrogant. The episodic narrative transports the reader from the breathtaking terrain of the Caucasus to the genteel surroundings of spa resorts. Told in an engaging yet pointedly ironic style, the story expresses Lermontov's own estrangement from the stifling conventions of bourgeois society and the oppression of Russian autocracy, but it also captures a longing for freedom through acts of love and bravery. <br><br>Andrew Kahn's introduction sheds light on the novel's relation to orientalism and the ethnographic and anthropological discourses of the day, and his informative notes illuminate a wide range of historical, literary, and geographical references.

Pouring into developing-world &#x201c;instant cities&#x201d; like Dubai and Shenzhen, these urban newcomers confront a modern world cobbled together from fragments of a West they have never seen. Do these fantastical boomtowns, where blueprints spring to life overnight on virgin land, represent the dawning of a brave new world? Or is their vaunted newness a mirage? <p>In a captivating blend of history and reportage, Daniel Brook travels to a series of major metropolitan hubs that were once themselves instant cities&#x2015; St. Petersburg, Shanghai, and Mumbai&#x2015;to watch their &#x201c;dress rehearsals for the twenty-first century.&#x201d; Understanding today&#x2019;s emerging global order, he argues, requires comprehending the West&#x2019;s profound and conflicted influence on developing-world cities over the centuries.</p><p>In 1703, Tsar Peter the Great personally oversaw the construction of a new Russian capital, a &#x201c;window on the West&#x201d; carefully modeled on Amsterdam, that he believed would wrench Russia into the modern world. In the nineteenth century, Shanghai became the fastest-growing city on earth as it mushroomed into an English-speaking, Western-looking metropolis that just happened to be in the Far East. Meanwhile, Bombay, the cosmopolitan hub of the British Raj, morphed into a tropical London at the hands of its pith-helmeted imperialists.</p><p>Juxtaposing the stories of the architects and authoritarians, the artists and revolutionaries who seized the reins to transform each of these precociously modern places into avatars of the global future, Brook demonstrates that the drive for modernization was initially conflated with wholesale Westernization. He shows, too, the ambiguous legacy of that emulation&#x2015;the birth (and rebirth) of Chinese capitalism in Shanghai, the origins of Bollywood in Bombay&#x2019;s American-style movie palaces, the combustible mix of revolutionary culture and politics that rocked the Russian capital&#x2015;and how it may be transcended today.</p><p>A fascinating, vivid look from the past out toward the horizon, <em>A History of Future Cities</em> is both a crucial reminder of globalization&#x2019;s long march and an inspiring look into the possibilities of our Asian Century.</p> 12 illustrations; 4 maps</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2013:</strong> When East meets West, the results can be surprising. Nowhere is this better displayed than in journalist Daniel Brook's <i>A History of Future Cities</i>, a book about Mumbai, Dubai, St. Petersburg, and Shanghai--four cities perched at the delta between Western and Eastern civilization. In these metropolises, imperialist and nationalist influences have layered, mixed, and aggregated into unusual new forms. Identity crises abound in St. Petersburg, built by Peter the Great, who fell in love with Amsterdam and tried to re-create it on a frozen Russian swamp; in Shanghai, propelled into the modern world as a foreign-dominated, no-passport-needed, economic and moral free zone. Brook explores cross-cultural politics, architecture, and ambitions reflected in four places that not only shaped history but may also indicate the future of many crossroad cities. --<i>Amazon Editors</i>Daniel Brook is a journalist and author whose writing has appeared in Harper&#x2019;s, the New York Times Magazine, and The Nation.

University of Kent at Canterbury The Man in the Iron Mask is the final episode in the cycle of novels featuring Dumas celebrated foursome of D Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, who first appeared in The Three Musketeers. Some thirty-five years on, the bonds of comradeship are under strain as they end up on different sides in a power struggle that may undermine the young Louis XIV and change the face of the French monarchy. In the fast-paced narrative style that was his trademark, Dumas pitches us straight into the action. What is the secret shared by Aramis and Madame de Chevreuse? Why does the Queen Mother fear its revelation? Who is the mysterious prisoner in the Bastille? And what is the nature of the threat he poses? Dumas, the master storyteller, keeps us reading until the climactic scene in the grotto of Locmaria, a fitting conclusion to the epic saga of the musketeers.</p><p>The Musketeers are back in another exciting adventure! This time a terrible secret threatens to bring down the throne of France.

Interested in writing from an early age, Dumas left for Paris where he found work in the household of the Duc D&#39;Orleans. He soon found success writing historical plays and gained important friendships, money and the Librarianship of the Palais Royale. By 1832 his plays were celebrated throughout France, but he contracted cholera and was sent to Switzerland to convalesce. There he took to writing travel books and eventually turned to fiction, primarily adventure stories and historical novels, for which he has an enduring reputation.

In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Program Evaluation for Social Workers: Foundations of Evidence-Based Programs</h2><p>Now in its seventh edition, this comprehensive text once again provides beginning social work students and practitioners with a proven, time-tested approach to help them understand and appreciate how to use basic evaluation techniques within their individual cases (case-level) and the programs where they work (program-level).

It discusses the modernization of the Ottoman Empire during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the spread of nationalism among its subject peoples, and the revolutionary changes in Ottoman institutions and society that led to the Empire&#39;s demise and the rise of the democratic Republic of Turkey. Based on extensive research in the Ottoman archives as well as Western sources, this volume analyzes the external pressures, reform measures, institutional changes, and intellectual movements that affected the heterogeneous Ottoman society during the Empire&#39;s last century.

At the start of the second book, most of south Brooklyn is in ruins and the nation is terrified. Nearly everyone that Lyric Walker loves is either missing or presumed dead, including the mesmerizing prince Fathom. It&#x2019;s up to Lyric to unite the Alpha before the second wave of a cataclysmic invasion wipes out mankind for good. The Undertow trilogy is an unforgettable reading experience that author E. Lockhart calls, "Allegorical and romantic, the book&nbsp;nevertheless reads like an action movie with especially awesome CGI."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Michael Buckley </b>is<b> </b>the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series Sisters Grimm and NERDS. Before starting to write children&#x2019;s books, he worked as a stand-up comic, television writer, advertising copywriter, and a singer in a punk rock band. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. Visit his website at www.michaelbuckleywrites.com.Gr 9 Up-Buckley, who dove into the YA world with last year's Undertow (HMH, 2015), continues his scary mermaid dystopia, an allegory for the current American political scene, in this fast-paced follow-up. The story begins where the previous installment left off, with half-Alpha Lyric Walker and her companions on the run from government forces. After the destruction of Coney Island and massive loss of life, which occurs in the previous volume, Lyric has been branded a terrorist, with the entire nation eager for her capture. Determined to free her family from their captivity, Lyric journeys across the Texan landscape, meeting new allies and facing off with all manner of foes. Plot twists come quickly, but some of them rely on a lack of common sense from a previously sensible protagonist, which can distract from the story. Lyric may be the only teen in America who has never seen a crime procedural and is unaware that authorities can track locations through a phone's GPS. The violence inflicted on the captive Alpha at the government facility Tempest can be gruesome, even when it is merely described after the fact, and the government brings nothing but strife to its citizens in this version of the United States. It's a bleak view of the world, which may resonate with politically aware teen readers. Like its predecessor, the book ends with an epic battle and loss of life. VERDICT Fans of the first title will clamor for this sequel, but the harsh world and large cast of characters may keep new readers from this volume.-Elisabeth Gattullo Marrocolla, Darien Library, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Perhaps one of the least understood, and yet most important and relevant factors in the covenant relationships that God has chosen to employ in His dealings with man, is the blood covenant. This covenant of life and death spans the entire sacrificial system of the Old Testament, and is the basis for the act of Communion in the Church today. &#x201c;The author seems to prove beyond a doubt that the blood covenant is one of the most ancient and universal institutions. This idea is founded on the representation familiar to Old Testament scholars, that the blood stands for life.&#x201d; In this volume, which has been sold out and unavailable for generations, you will find truths that will bless every pastor, every teacher, every serious Christian desiring a deeper knowledge of God and His covenants with man.</p><p></p><h2>Philosophy: The Quest for Truth</h2><p>Praised for its accessibility and comprehensiveness, <em>Philosophy: The Quest for Truth</em> provides an excellent selection of classical and contemporary readings on nineteen key problems in philosophy.

This book attempts to illuminate some of the historically significant technical developments that were incorporated into World War II aircraft engines that directly contributed to the execution and tactics of the war. <p>Although numerous books have been published on all of the more common World War II aircraft and several books have been published on engines, rarely have the two been brought together. </p><p><i>Allied Aircraft Piston Engines of World War II</i> offers an interesting look at the technology that was so important to eventual Allied victory. The book is organized into separate sections on British and U.S. aircraft piston engines. Aircraft engines detailed in the book include: Rolls-Royce - Merlin, Griffon, Peregrine, Vulture; Bristol - Poppet Valve Engines, Mercury, Pegasus,Sleeve Valve Engines, Hercules, Taurus, Centaurus; Napier - Rapier, Dagger, Sabre; General Electric Turbosuperchargers; Pratt and Whitney - R-1340 Wasp, R-985 Wasp Jr., R-1535 Twin Wasp Jr., R-1830 Twin Wasp,R-2000, R-2800 Double Wasp, R-4360 Wasp Major; Allison - V-1710, V-3420; and Wright Aeronautical Corporation - R-1820 Cyclone, R-2600 Cyclone 14, R-3350 Cyclone 18, R-4090. </p><p>This book also includes chapters on: Aircraft Engine Requirements (fuels, charge heating, radiator development, lubrication, and more); and Hyper Activity and Other Near Misses. </p><p>An enjoyable, informative book for aeronautical engineers, aircraft enthusiasts, WWII veterans and buffs, and historians.</p></p><p>Though born in England, Graham White has spent most of his life in the USA. A mechanical engineer by profession, White now negotiates and writes contracts for IBM. White has had a lifelong interest in aviation and its history, and in particular, the piston engines of World War II. He has collected and restored several of these engines to exhibition condition and working order in his own workshops. He is also an avid collector of the classics of engineering and aviation literature, and an active member of the Society of Automotive Engineers."Definitive books on the subject seem to appear about once in a generation.

As a German citizen, Heiden watched Hitler grow from a small-time demagogue and failed revolutionary to a dangerously influential politician and finally dictator in total control of his party and eventually Germany. Starting with Hitler's unpromising youth and first political missteps, Heiden concludes with a gripping account of the "blood purge" of June 1934, in which Hitler executed his potential rivals in the Nazi Party and confirmed his monstrous vision for Germany.<br>This striking narrative of the great German dictator's rise also illuminates the national character of the German people - those people who committed the crimes that aided the Fuhrer and those who allowed them to be committed.<br>"Unique in its abundance of details, and it ranks beside the classics of historical writing" - Christian Science Monitor<br>"Remorselessly, ruthlessly objective" - New York Times Book Review<br>"[A] superior piece of writing . . .

Although his subjects were close at hand usually everyday domestic scenes Bonnard rarely painted from life. Instead, he made pencil sketches in diaries and relied on these, along with his memory, as he executed the works in his studio. These interiors thus often conflate details from the artist&#x2019;s daily life with fleeting, mysterious evocations of his past. The spectral figures who appear at the margins of the canvases, overshadowed by brilliantly colored baskets of fruit or other props, create an atmosphere of profound ambiguity and puzzling abstraction: the mundane rendered in a wholly new pictorial language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 75 paintings, drawings, and watercolors in this volume, some rarely seen treasures from private collections, all&nbsp;made between 1923 and 1947, are central to the ongoing reappraisal of Bonnard as a leading figure of French modernism.</p></p><p><p>Dita Amory is Associate Curator, Robert Lehman Collection, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.</p>&#x201c;. . . this handsome volume includes seventy-five carefully selected works from galleries and private collections from around the world . . .&nbsp; These works are fresh, engaging and superbly presented in a book that will warm the heart of each and every art lover.&#x201d; &#x2014; Good Book Guide<br> (<i>Good Book Guide</i> 2009-05-01)</p><h2>Test Success: Test-Taking Techniques for Beginning Nursing Students (Davis's Q&amp;A Success)</h2><p><ul><br> <li>Approximately 900 questions in all...<br> <ul><br> <li>800 in the text, including a comprehensive 100-question exam at the end of the book</li><br> <li>150 unique questions online at Davis<em>Plus</em>, (including more than 300 alternate format) customizable by concept and content area, all with NCLEX descriptors and rationales for correct and incorrect answers</li><br> </ul><br> </li><br> <li>Study and test-taking strategies with basic nursing theory and skills</li><br> <li>&#x201c;Knowledge Analysis&#x201d; tool focusing on how to identify clusters of errors in specific knowledge categories on a test</li><br> <li>&#x201c;Corrective Action Guide&#x201d; describing what to do to correct test-taking errors</li><br> <li>&#x201c;Information Processing Analysis&#x201d; tool presenting topics relating to the process of test taking, including processing errors and personal performance trends</li><br> <li>Time management strategies with tips and suggestions that specifically address the challenges of working full or part-time and juggling multiple responsibilities throughout nursing school </li><br> <li>Coverage of empowerment, critical thinking, the nursing process, and computer applications in education and evaluation</li><br> <li>Maslow&#x2019;s Hierarchy of Needs Triangle featured in Chapter 6, The Nursing Process</li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>Applied Pharmaceutics in Contemporary Compounding</h2><p>Applied Pharmaceutics in Contemporary Compounding is designed to convey a fundamental understanding of the principles and practices involved in both the development and the production of compounded dosage forms by applying pharmaceutical principles.

While they eagerly awaited Christ&#x2019;s return, many believers were placing more value on their future hope than on peoples&#x2019; current needs. Paul addressed this concern with a message that still resonates today. This study examines Paul&#x2019;s second letter to the Thessalonians and shares the need for a church that is focused on both heaven and earth. &nbsp;The Wiersbe Bible Study Series delivers practical, in-depth guides to selected books of the Bible.

He uses the fifteen monumental decision-making disasters to illustrate the potential consequences of these common tactical errors and traps and then details successful alternative decision-making approaches.<br> Why Decisions Fail translates decades of award-winning research into practical terms that managers can use to improve their own decision-making practices.</p><p>Paul C.

He has written more than one hundred articles and six books. His current research interests include organizational decision making and radical change.<br> The decision-making stream of work, drawn upon to write this book, is taken from more than two decades of research into the decision-making practices used by people in organizations and how to improve them. Articles first appeared in 1984 and have continued at a steady pace since then, with several currently in press. In all, thirty-eight articles have appeared or will appear in referred journals and more are planned.

His other work in decision making involves decision analysis, risk measurement, using MBTI and the Ennea- gram to identify a person&#x2019;s decision style, Multiattribute Utilities, ethics, and learning.Nutt (management, Ohio State Univ.) has spent 20 years collecting and studying more than 400 decisions made by upper-level management in corporate, government, and nonprofit organizations. Here, he selects 15 decisions that led to debacles and gives the background for each decision, what went wrong, and how the problem could have been approached differently. Through these case studies and other examples, he reveals a number of traps he has discerned in the decision-making process, including limiting the search for alternatives to a manager's preconceived ideas, failing to learn from mistakes by not accepting their existence, and misreading potential opposition. The debacles cited by Nutt, all well known, include locating EuroDisney outside Paris, mislabeling BeechNut apple juice, and Ford's showing an unwillingness to fix faulty Pinto gas tanks. Nutt's thorough dissection of the debacles and explanation of the decision-making process makes this book essential for libraries supporting management programs, while his clear writing style makes it accessible to patrons at larger public libraries.

In describing the facts of his life in clear and concise prose, he fueled the abolitionist movement of the early nineteenth century in the United States.</p><p>In this seminal work, Douglass details the cruelty of slave holders, how slaves were supposed to behave in the presence of their masters, the fear that kept many slaves where they were, and the punishments received by any slave who dared to tell the truth about their treatment. He learned to read and write while still a slave but also suffered at the hands of whites. He was starved, worked the fields until he collapsed, was beaten for collapsing, was jailed for two years after planning an escape attempt, and nearly lost his left eye in an attack while he was an apprentice in a shipyard.</p><p>Douglass succeeded in escaping to the North and finding his own freedom but kept many details of his journey a secret to protect those who helped him and, hopefully, allow others to escape.</p><p>Augmented by large sidebars written by soldiers, statesmen, and abolitionists from the antebellum period, as well as pieces by well-known historians and prominent African-Americans, and some new pieces by current historians and writers, this richly illustrated edition of this classic American autobiography sheds new light on Douglass's famous text for a new generation of readers.</p></p><p><p><b>Frederick Douglass</b> (1818-1895) was an African American social reformer, orator, writer, and statesman.

In what would be his last home, he enjoyed the camaraderie of fellow artists and an unparalleled burst of creativity.<p> The auberge still operates today as the Maison de Van Gogh.

Written by one of America's foremost culinary historians, with Dr. Fred Leeman, the former chief curator of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, and including an introduction by the auberge's proprietor, this unique cookbook/art book explores life in the artists' cafT, with traditional recipes ranging from the hearty to the refined. Letters, engravings, postcards, and a selection of Van Gogh's paintings transport the reader to the turn of the century.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Beyond the well-known, sometimes lurid, events of renowned painter Vincent van Gogh's short life lies a much more mild daily existence of meals with friends and neighbors. <i>Van Gogh's Table</i> presents a gentle and kinder look at the visionary's world. Authors Alexandra Leaf, a culinary historian, and Fred Leeman, the former chief curator of the Van Gogh Museum, offer a tale of the artist's life through the lens of his last home, the Auberge Ravoux. Van Gogh was a constant traveler who frequently boarded at small hotels and dined in caf�s. During his few months at this inn, van Gogh produced numerous magical works. As a tribute to the incredible painter, and the caf� life that inspired him, Leaf and Leeman have brought together stories and images of the artist's life and work with menus from his days at the Auberge Ravoux. Try recipes like Warm Tarte Tatin with Cr�me Fraiche or Dark Chocolate Souffl� Cake with Cr�me Anglaise to experience the sweeter side of van Gogh's world.

Here is an intimate view into Van Gogh's world as stirring as sharing poulet and pommes sautees with the artist himself, and quite as delicious.</p><p> As an artist, Vincent van Gogh spent most of his life in cafes, hotels, and small inns. These establishments often became the subjects of his paintings, as did the people he met there, many now immortalized in portraits. In the cafT he found a place of life in the shadow of this own isolation. And he found food, drink, and friendship.</p><p> Written by a culinary historian and the former chief curator of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, in cooperation with the Institut Van Gogh, Van Gogh's Table explores the artist's sojourn at the Auberge Ravoux and presents nearly fifty of its recipes.

These eleven essays in history and anthropology offer a novel perspective on these debates by questioning the place of sexual dimorphism in culture and history. They propose a new role for the study of alternative sex and gender systems in cultural science, as a means of critiquing thinking that privileges standard male/female gender distinctions and rejects the natural basis of other forms of sexuality.The essays cover a wide range of times and cultures, starting in the Byzantine Empire and moving eclectically forward, with a special focus on the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. The anthropological studies include the Native American berdache, the Indian Hijras caste, hermaphrodites in Melanesia, third genders in Indonesia and the Balkans, and transsexuals in America.Third Sex, Third Gender emphasizes desires on the margins of society, and pleasures and bodies outside the assumed arenas of social reproduction. It opens up the possibility of understanding in new ways how, for example, Byzantine palace eunuchs and the Hijras of India met the criteria of special social roles that necessitated self-castration, and how heartfelt yet forbidden desires were expressed among seventeenth-century Dutch Sodomites, the Mollys of eighteenth-century England, and the Intermediate Sex or so-called hermaphrodite-homosexual of nineteenth-century Europe and America.</p><p><b>Essays<br></b>Introduction, Gilbert Herdt � Living in the Shadows: Eunuchs and Gender in Byzantium, Kathryn M.

But not all cultures share this essentialist assumption and even Western societies have not always embraced it. Bringing together historical and anthropological studies, Third Sex, Third Gender challenges the usual emphasis on sexual dimorphism and reproduction, providing a unique perspective on the various forms of socialization of people who are neither &#34;male&#34; nor &#34;female&#34;. The existence of a third sex or gender enables us to understand how Byzantine palace eunuchs and Indian hijras met the criteria of special social roles that necessitated practices such as self-castration and how intimate and forbidden desires were expressed among the Dutch Sodomites in the early modern period, the Sapphists of eighteenth-century England or the so-called hermaphrodite-homosexuals of nineteenth-century Europe and America. By contextualizing these practices and by allowing these bodies, meanings and desires to emerge, Third Sex, Third Gender provides a new way to think about sex and gender systems that is crucial to contemporary debates within the social sciences.Gilbert Herdt is Professor of Human Development at the University of Chicago.

This volume is an exposition of the newest developments in the technology of Cosmic Orgone Engineering, which involve the use of "Spacegun," an extension of the cloudbuster made possible by the discovery of ORUR.During Reich's scientific expedition to southern Arizona (1954&#x2013;1955)--which he documents in this book--it was Cosmic Orgone Engineering that caused desert land to turn green with prairie grass. Here Reich submits a natural scientific explanation of the metabolism of the Life Energy, a study which goes into the nature of primal vegetation, and the nature of dying or death of vegetation, i.e. desert development.Nature being one, Contact With Space examines the new basic energetic facts brought into the open by the Oranur Experiment in terms of the various branches of science into which they ramify: biophysics, Oranur medicine, astrophysics, meteorology, chemistry and pre-atomic chemistry, space technology, man's reactions to these events, etc. It also deals with the methods of the functional scientist.Written under unrelenting attack from conspiratorial commercial interests, this book gives some of the background into the difficult social and physical milieu in which this research was done, and conveys the excitement of the adventures that began the cosmic or "atomic" age.</p><p></p><h2>A Little Way of Homeschooling</h2><p>Suzie Andres and twelve other Catholic homeschoolers describe how they implement an &#34;unschooling&#34; style of teaching in their homes. Drawing from St. Therese, St. John Bosco, John Holt (How Children Learn and How Children Fail), and ancient philosophers, the families paint a picture of authentic education without the constraints and pitfalls of typical modern education. Andres admirably addresses the question of whether a Catholic can happily and sanely unschool by explaining it as a sensible approach to the mystery of learning, not as an ideology in competition with her faith. The heart of the book is the honest and humble description of home education by twelve homeschooling mothers who have embraced unschooling in varying degrees. Anyone interested in education and particularly home education will be inspired by their narratives.</p><p></p><h2>Autonomia, new edition: Post-Political Politics (Semiotext(e) Journal)</h2><p><p><b>The only first-hand document and contemporaneous analysis of the most innovative post-'68 radical movement in the West, the creative, futuristic, neo-anarchistic, postideological Autonomia.</b></p><p>Most of the writers who contributed to the issue were locked up at the time in Italian jails....

The movement itself was broken when Autonomia members were falsely accused of (and prosecuted for) being the intellectual masterminds of the Red Brigades; but even after the end of Autonomia, this book remains a crucial testimony of the way this creative, futuristic, neo-anarchistic, postideological, and nonrepresentative political movement of young workers and intellectuals anticipated issues that are now confronting us in the wake of Empire.

In spite of their centuries-long coexistence with mainstream Europeans, our picture of this people remains rooted in stereotypes and myths that have little in common with contemporary social reality. Full-fledged citizens of the European Union, and ostensibly protected by the world's most progressive human rights legislation, many Roma live under conditions that challenge our notions of Europe, modernity, and pluralism.</p><p>This book is about a Romani settlement in eastern Slovakia. It is a community that has grown to become one of the largest and most problematic townships of rural Roma in the entire district. The dark-skinned squatters on the margins of Svinia are segregated from the surrounding society by means of physical and social barriers entrenched in local ideology and enforced by rules and conventions reminiscent of apartheid.</p><p>David Scheffel offers a detailed ethnographic account of the social, cultural, and historical circumstances that have encouraged and supported inter-ethnic inequality in the region.

I shrug, staring at a folded dishtowel next to the sink. It&#x2019;s red and white with a picture of a rooster on it. &#x201c;It was a really big zit,&#x201d; I say. I cleaned the blood from my face and covered the piercing with a Band-Aid before my mom saw it, but I&#x2019;ve had to change the Band-Aid twice since she&#x2019;s been home. Already the new one is red with blood.</p><p>Mom puts the chicken in the fridge, frowning as she closes the door. Our phone rings, and Mom leans over the counter and picks it up. &#x201c;Flores residence,&#x201d; she answers. A tinny-sounding voice echoes from the other end of the receiver, and Mom smiles. &#x201c;One moment. It&#x2019;s your friend Riley,&#x201d; she says, handing me the phone. &#x201c;She says she has a homework question. Just don&#x2019;t take too long.&#x201d;</p><p>I slip out the back door with the phone and curl up in the wooden chair on our patio. Our backyard stretches forever, without any streetlights or nearby houses to break it up. It&#x2019;s unnerving, like being walled in on all sides with empty space. Insects buzz restlessly, like white noise. I tuck my legs beneath me.</p><p>&#x201c;Riley?&#x201d; I say into the phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Sof? I saw you with Brooklyn!&#x201d; My stomach twists, but Riley continues talking before I can worry about whether she changed her mind about the spying. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me? What did you find out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, really. She took me with her to get a tattoo.&#x201d; I run a finger along the edge of the bandage on my forehead but decide to keep the details of my piercing to myself.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; Riley sounds disappointed. I lower my hand, quiet for a second as I try to work out what I want to say.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you expect me to find?&#x201d; My voice comes out sharper than I intend, but I don&#x2019;t apologize for it. Riley said she was trying to help Brooklyn, but it sounds like she just wanted her to screw up.</p><p>&#x201c;She skinned a cat and left it outside our school.&#x201d; Riley&#x2019;s voice has an edge to it. &#x201c;Or did you forget?&#x201d;</p><p>I press my lips together to keep myself from arguing. Riley thinks Brooklyn skinned that cat. Tattoos and cigarettes aren&#x2019;t in the same league as animal mutilation.</p><p>Riley clears her throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you okay, Sof? She didn&#x2019;t hurt you, did she? Or manipulate you in some way?&#x201d; The concern in Riley&#x2019;s voice is real, and suddenly I feel terrible. Riley&#x2019;s been a real friend to me since I got here, not Brooklyn. I exhale and shake my head, pulling at a piece of loose skin near my fingernail.</p><p>&#x201c;No, it was nothing like that. She was . . .&#x201d; Cool. The word pops into my head uninvited. &#x201c;She was weird,&#x201d; I finish instead.</p><p>As the word leaves my mouth I realize it&#x2019;s just as true. Brooklyn was cool, but I get what Riley means&#x2014; something about her did feel off. I think of her slender fingers on Santos&#x2019;s needles, her wolfish grin, and how she persuaded me so effortlessly to get a piercing. She made it too easy to be bad.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll find something better tomorrow,&#x201d; I mumble. There&#x2019;s a beat of silence. I clear my throat. &#x201c;How are things between you and Josh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, didn&#x2019;t you hear? We&#x2019;re all better now,&#x201d; Riley says. &#x201c;He sent flowers to my class third period. Roses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow. That&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Riley says before I can continue. &#x201c;I just want to say I&#x2019;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable when I asked you to hang out with Brooklyn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Riley, you didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I insist. &#x201c;Really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I think she really needs help. I have this feeling like she&#x2019;s standing on the edge of a cliff and she&#x2019;s about to go over. Like she&#x2019;ll fall if we don&#x2019;t help her.&#x201d;</p><p>I run my thumb over a cuticle in slow circles. I try to picture Brooklyn at the edge of a cliff, her combat boots sending rocks off the edge, but it just doesn&#x2019;t fit with the girl I hung out with this afternoon. Brooklyn was having fun, not crying out for help. &#x201c;You really think it&#x2019;s that bad?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I really do. Did she tell you she&#x2019;s having a party tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t mention it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I heard some kids talking about it at school. It&#x2019;s supposed to be intense. You should go.&#x201d;</p><p>I run my tongue over my lips, which are dry now from the cold creeping over the yard. The last party I went to was in a house in the woods, next to the train tracks that ran through town. A bunch of football players stood just inside the door, loudly rating every girl who walked past, and every time a train rolled through, the whole house shook and everyone took a shot.</p><p>When I don&#x2019;t answer right away, Riley starts to plead. &#x201c;Come on, Sofia! There&#x2019;s a reason I picked you for this. Some people have evil inside them, but that&#x2019;s what God is for, to fix them when they can&#x2019;t fix themselves. We can still fix Brooklyn.&#x201d;</p><p>The insects in the yard have gone still, but wind sweeps over the grass and pounds against the windows. I shiver and pull my arms around my chest. Grandmother used to pray for people in her neighborhood when she thought they needed strength. This isn&#x2019;t any different, I guess. Riley&#x2019;s just a little more active with her faith. Grams would probably like her.</p><p>&#x201c;Sof? Are you still there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it. Promise.&#x201d;</p><p>* * *</p><p>I shiver as I make my way to Brooklyn&#x2019;s for the party the next night. An owl hoots in a nearby tree. I pull my sweatshirt tighter around my shoulders and lower my face. Wind sweeps through the tree branches, rattling them like bones. A man with a sagging gut and pock-marked face winks at me.</p><p>&#x201c;How you doing, cutie?&#x201d; he mumbles. His breath smells like whiskey and beef jerky. I hurry past him as he stumbles toward a dimly lit bar.</p><p>Brooklyn lives on the first floor of a cheap apartment complex. It&#x2019;s set up to look like a motel. All the apartment doors face an open-air hallway protected only by the cheap, painted aluminum guardrail. Just beyond the edge of the property, I can see the service road that leads to the tattoo parlor.</p><p>A sound like a gunshot echoes down the dark alley near her street. I freeze, every muscle in my body tensing to run. Then a car engine sputters on, and an old Buick pulls away from the curb. Not a gunshot&#x2014;a car backfiring. I exhale and keep moving. The sooner I make it to Brooklyn&#x2019;s place, the better.</p><p>Even if she hadn&#x2019;t slipped me the address in English lit class, I wouldn&#x2019;t have trouble finding Brooklyn&#x2019;s party. The music&#x2019;s so loud it vibrates through the parking lot, and the apartment door hangs open. Girls in short skirts and pierced, tattooed guys lounge against the wall, drinking from red Solo cups and smoking cigarettes that smell like pine needles. Green paint bubbles up around where they stubbed the butts out on the walls. Either they&#x2019;re all over twenty-one, or this isn&#x2019;t the kind of neighborhood that calls the cops for underage drinking.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, little girl!&#x201d; someone calls, startling me. I turn just as a large bald guy approaches. He towers above me, and he has to weigh at least two hundred pounds. He wears all black, and a white-and-black skull tattoo covers his face and bald head. It looks like he doesn&#x2019;t have any skin.</p><p>I start to turn back around, hoping he&#x2019;s not talking to me. He grabs my arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be like that. I&#x2019;m talking to you,&#x201d; he says. Deep black lines shadow his eyes, and tattoos of teeth stretch down over his lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a question.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shoot,&#x201d; I say, struggling to keep my voice steady. The man&#x2019;s lips part, but I can&#x2019;t tell if he&#x2019;s smiling at me or grimacing.</p><p>&#x201c;My friends and I are taking a poll.&#x201d; He nods to a group of people standing by the apartment door. They&#x2019;re all pierced and tattooed, but next to Skull Guy they look like members of a church group. &#x201c;If you could choose how you were going to die, would you rather be beaten to death with a shovel or have your face eaten off?&#x201d;</p><p>I swallow, trying to keep my nerves from showing on my face. The guy might be freaky looking, but he just wants to get a reaction out of me. It&#x2019;s all just part of his game.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d go for the face,&#x201d; I say, meeting his gaze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d want to look my killer in the eye.&#x201d;</p><p>This time I&#x2019;m sure Skull Guy smiles at me. The white-and-black cheekbone tattoos stretch across his face when his lips part. &#x201c;Solid,&#x201d; he says, bumping my fist.</p><p>I nod at a couple more people as I walk past, trying to look like I belong. The music pounds around me, an insistent bomp bomp bomp. Once inside, I push my sweatshirt hood back and glance around the room. It&#x2019;s smoky and dark. Bodies crowd around me, packed so tightly I can&#x2019;t move without bumping someone&#x2019;s arm or back. The floor is sticky, littered with empty beer cans.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t believe I worried this would be anything like my last party. It&#x2019;s a completely different world. I&#x2019;ve never heard the music before, and I don&#x2019;t think any of the people here actually go to our school. A girl with long, white-blond hair and glassy eyes passes a tiny bag of powder to another girl in a leather jacket, then walks away without glancing at her. I weave through the crowd to a table covered in booze and beer. I grab the single can of off-brand soda sitting next to a case of PBR, just so I have something to do with my hands.</p><p>A voice rises above the music, startling me. &#x201c;Sofia!&#x201d;</p><p>I turn and, through the sea of people pushing in on me, spot Charlie waving his hands above his head like he&#x2019;s signaling planes. If I were a cartoon character, my mouth would drop to the floor and exclamation points would shoot out of my eyes&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how excited I am to see him standing there, wearing a worn T-shirt with some faded sports logo on it and a dark gray zip-up sweatshirt. He moves around a crowd of guys to stand in front of me and says something I can&#x2019;t hear over the noise. I smile so wide the corners of my mouth threaten to split.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I shout.</p><p>He grins back at me, and even in the dark I notice the dimple in his cheek. Pushing the hair from my neck, he leans in close enough that his breath warms my skin.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s loud,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Wanna go outside?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>Charlie takes my hand, and we head for the back of the apartment to a smudged sliding glass door. I crack open my soda as Charlie pushes through the door and we slip outside. Cold air rushes to greet me, and I shiver, almost glad the can is warm, even if the soda tastes terrible.</p><p>&#x201c;You seem to be the only other person here not trying to get completely hammered,&#x201d; Charlie says once we&#x2019;ve left the pounding music behind.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a big drinker,&#x201d; I say. Charlie nods.</p><p>&#x201c;Me neither.&#x201d; He smiles at me again, that dimple appearing in his cheek. My stomach flips.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re here. I don&#x2019;t really know anyone else.&#x201d; Charlie glances around at the kids sprawled on lawn chairs and hovering near the apartment door. At first I don&#x2019;t recognize any of them, either, but then I spot Tom wearing a backward baseball cap. He leans forward, passing his cigarette to a cute girl with black dreadlocks and thick glasses. The girl giggles at something he says, then leans in to kiss him. I cringe. Grace would be devastated.</p><p>Charlie sees him, too. &#x201c;I know Tom, I guess. But he&#x2019;s been preoccupied. Josh said he was coming, but I haven&#x2019;t seen him. And now I know you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Josh is coming to this party?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t think this was Josh&#x2019;s scene&#x2014;he seems so preppy, like Riley. Charlie shrugs.</p><p>I glance around at the patchy grass and dirty white lawn chairs. Beyond them, I see the outlines of a slide, a swing set, and what I assume is a pool surrounded by high wooden fencing. Despite the cold weather, I hear giggling and splashing.</p><p>A smile creeps across my face. I pull on Charlie&#x2019;s sleeve. &#x201c;Come on. I have a plan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we going swimming?&#x201d; Charlie asks when I start to lead him toward the pool.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s, like, fifty degrees out!&#x201d; I pull my sweatshirt tighter around my shoulders. &#x201c;Besides, I don&#x2019;t have a suit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201d;Why should that stop you?&#x201d;</p><p>I groan and push him toward the slide instead. The playground equipment is made of that old steel that isn&#x2019;t used at schools anymore, because people are afraid kids will impale themselves on the sharp metal while playing. I approach the slide hesitantly and test the bottom ladder rung to make sure it&#x2019;ll hold my weight.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d; Charlie says. I raise an eyebrow in challenge.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s either the slide with me, or you go back to the party to hang out with people who don&#x2019;t even remember their names. Your choice.&#x201d;</p><p>Charlie purses his lips, pretending to think this over. &#x201c;Which people, exactly?&#x201d;</p><p>I pick up a rock and threaten to throw it at him, and he raises his hands in surrender, laughing. &#x201c;Kidding, kidding.&#x201d; He jogs to the bottom of the slide and crouches down. &#x201c;Okay, go. I&#x2019;ll catch you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you to catch me,&#x201d; I say. I set my soda down on the ground and climb up the ladder, perching on top of the slide. Charlie grins.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you do.&#x201d; He grabs the sides of the slide with both hands and shakes, causing the entire thing to rattle. &#x201c;This thing is a death trap.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite the coolness of the night, the metal is warm beneath my hands. I push myself down, and as I start to gather speed, I shriek. Charlie grabs my shoulders before I hit the dirt and holds me steady.</p><p>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; he asks. He actually looks concerned. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe they let kids on that thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your turn,&#x201d; I say, pushing myself back to my feet. </p><p>Charlie grins and races around to the ladder. The entire slide rocks as he climbs, the metal creaking so badly I&#x2019;m convinced it&#x2019;s about to fall apart.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Charlie says as he settles at the top. &#x201c;Now I have so much more respect for you for going first.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m a rebel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here goes nothing.&#x201d; Charlie pushes off and shoots down the slide. Somewhere along the way he goes into warp speed, and then he&#x2019;s not sliding anymore&#x2014; he&#x2019;s flying&#x2014;and I can&#x2019;t move out of the way before he tumbles into me. We both roll backward, hitting the dirt in a tangle of limbs.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; he says, pushing himself onto an elbow. He doesn&#x2019;t roll off me right away. &#x201c;Did I break you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I keep my arms still because I don&#x2019;t trust myself not to grab his sweatshirt and pull him even closer. I clear my throat. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re . . . fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Charlie tilts his head, and I wonder if he can tell what I&#x2019;m thinking. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really glad you&#x2019;re here, Sofia,&#x201d; he says. </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, I did break your fall,&#x201d; I say. He still doesn&#x2019;t move away from me. He brushes a curl off my forehead and shakes his head like I&#x2019;m missing something. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just that. I&#x2019;m glad to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>The night instantly grows ten degrees warmer. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking, right?&#x201d; Charlie eyes lose focus. He&#x2019;s about to kiss me. I inhale, hoping the warm soda hasn&#x2019;t made my mouth taste gross. But he just runs his thumb along my jaw, tracing from my ear to my chin, like he&#x2019;s memorizing my face.</p><p>&#x201c;I like you, okay?

The answers they gave did not have to be literally true; they only had to satisfy people's curiosity by providing an answer, less for the mind than for the soul." --From Chapter 1<br>Each of us has a story to tell that is uniquely personal and profoundly meaningful. The goal of the modern therapist is to help clients probe deeply enough to find their own voice, describe their experiences, and create a narrative in which a life story takes shape and makes sense. Emphasizing the vital connections among personal experience, family, and community, the authors of this provocative new book explore the role of narrative therapy within the context of a postmodern culture. They employ the interactional dynamics of family therapy to demonstrate how to help people deconstruct oppressive and debilitating perspectives, replace them with liberating and legitimizing stories, and develop a framework of meaning and direction for more intentional, more fulfilling lives. Blending scientific theory with literary aesthetics, <i>Story Re-Visions</i> presents a comprehensive collection of specific narrative therapy techniques, inventions, interviewing guidelines, and therapeutic questions.<br>The book examines the development of the postmodern phenomenon, tracing its evolution across time and disciplines. It discusses paradigmatic traditions, the meaning of modernism, and the ways in which the ancient, binding narratives have lost their power to inspire uncritical assent. Methods for doing narrative therapy in a destoried world are presented, with suggestions for meeting the challenges of postmodern value systems and ethical dilemmas.<br>Numerous case examples and dialogues illustrate ways to help people become authors of their own stories, and each of the last four chapters concludes with an appendix that provides additional information for the practicing clinician. Detailing ways in which a narrative framework enhances family therapy, the authors describe how the therapist and client may act together as revisionary editors, and present techniques for keeping the story re-vision alive, well, and in charge. Finally, the book examines re-vision techniques for clinical training and supervision settings, with discussion of how therapists may help one another create stories about their clients, as well as themselves.<br><br>Accessibly written and profoundly enlightening, <i>Story Re-Visions</i> is ideal for family therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and anyone else interested in doing therapy from a narrative stance. It is also valuable as supplemental reading for courses in family therapy and other psychotherapeutic disciplines. <br></p><p>Alan Parry, Ph.D., is a psychologist and family therapist in the Family Therapy Program at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, and a clinical lecturer in the Department of Psychiatry.

Yet these very words are said; simply put, people swear. In <strong><em>This Book is Taboo: An Introduction to Linguistics through Swearing</em></strong>, rather than condemning swearing or the people who swear, Randall Eggert applies the tools of linguistics, the scientific study of language, to understand how swearing functions in language--and in speakers. In an engaging and often playful manner, this textbook investigates swear words from many directions: </p><ul><li>What purpose does swearing serve?</li><li>Which concepts are likely to lead to swear words?&nbsp;</li><li>Why are some words more offensive than others, even when they mean the same thing?&nbsp;</li><li>What makes a word "bad?"</li><li>Is there a grammar to swearing?&nbsp;</li><li>Which words do different cultures see as taboo?</li><li>How do your race, sex, ethnicity, religion, age, social class, etc. affect the way you swear?&nbsp;</li><li>Do men swear more than women, and, if so, why?</li><li>How does swearing change over time and where did some of today's swear words come from?</li><li>How is swearing in a foreign language different from swearing in your native language?</li><li>What happens in the brain when you say or hear swear words?</li><li>Why are swear words more acceptable in some situations than others?</li><li>How do the FCC and other authorities determine what is acceptable to say and what is not?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This textbook is intended for anybody interested in language and the role swearing plays in it; no background in linguistics is required or expected. Readers are cautioned, however, that vivid, graphic, and potentially offensive examples are used to illustrate ideas, concepts, and theories. You cannot discuss taboo language adequately without violating some taboos; hence, this book is taboo.</p><p><strong>eBook Version</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You will receive access to this electronic text via email after using the shopping cart above to complete your purchase.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>The Original Illustrated Alice in Wonderland</h2><p>The Original Illustrated Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll with the original illustrations by John Tenniel, in color for this edition by Martina Selway, published by Castle Books copyright 1978, published in Yugoslavia September 1985.

Sometimes the monster swallowed them up. More often, though, the children fought the monster and grew stronger. This volume draws on the full breadth of this experience in showing how American Indian boarding schools provided both positive and negative influences for Native American children. The boarding schools became an integral part of American history, a shared history that resulted in Indians &#x201c;turning the power&#x201d; by using their school experiences to grow in wisdom and benefit their people. <p>The first volume of essays ever to focus on the American Indian boarding school experience, and written by some of the foremost experts and most promising young scholars of the subject, <i>Boarding School Blues</i> ranges widely in scope, addressing issues such as sports, runaways, punishment, physical plants, and Christianity. With comparative studies of the various schools, regions, tribes, and aboriginal peoples of the Americas and Australia, the book reveals both the light and the dark aspects of the boarding school experience and illuminates the vast gray area in between.</p></p><p>Clifford E.

In addition, the West encompasses not only the past and present of the area west of the Mississippi but also the frontier as it moved across each of the fifty American states, offering the promise of freedom and a better life to pioneers and settlers in every era. This authoritative, comprehensive, and lavishly illustrated single-volume encyclopedia is a rich source of information about these many American West, real and imaginary, old and new, stretching from coast to coast and throughout the country&#x2019;s history and culture.<br>The encyclopedia, a thoroughly revised and expanded version of Howard Lamar&#x2019;s acclaimed twenty-year-old <i>Reader&#x2019;s Encyclopedia of the American West</i>, consists of more than 2,400 entries in alphabetical order by more than 300 contributors, along with over 600 illustrations and maps (four times more than in the original edition).

That gunman John Wesley Hardin killed more people than either Jesse James or Billy the Kid? Or that Frederick Law Olmsted was once commissioned to manage the Yosemite Valley and was instrumental in the national-park movement? <i>The New Encyclopedia of the American West</i> is full of such interesting information. This weighty volume, compiled by Sterling Professor Emeritus of History at Yale University Howard R. Lamar, contains over 2,400 entries by more than 300 contributors on all aspects of the American West, from prehistory to the present. Types of entries include brief biographical sketches of important men and women, extensive descriptions of the physiogeography of the continent, pieces on art and literature of the West, and histories of the area's transportation systems. Over 600 illustrations and maps complement the text and help make this book a joy to read. Lamar provides a brief timeline of Western history to help put things in perspective, and the individual entries are extensively cross-referenced. A detailed index provides a comprehensive list of every person mentioned in the book, and most articles provide bibliographic citations to point the interested reader to further sources. The tone of the book is authoritative yet accessible--and refreshingly jargon-free.

His first short story collection, The Watch, set in Texas, won the PEN/Nelson Algren Award, and his 2002 collection, The Hermit&#39;s Story, was a Los Angeles Times Best Book of the Year. The Lives of Rocks was a finalist for the Story Prize and was chosen as a Best Book of the Year by the Rocky Mountain News. Bass&#39;s stories have also been awarded the Pushcart Prize and the O. Henry Award and have been collected in The Best American Short Stories.Two appealing short stories and an exquisite novella from Montana essayist and storyteller Bass (The Book of Yaak, 1996; In the Loyal Mountains, 1995, etc.). The title novella revels in the rugged beauty of bluffs and thickets in Texas hill country, where three generations preserve the family ranch as a haven for wild animals and the wild at heart. The narrator, a middle-aged woman living alone on the ranch with her memories, recalls her formative influences: iron-willed Grandfather, whose battle cry (``the natural history of Texas is still being sacrificed upon the altar of generalization'') was stifled by a stroke, then reemerged when the old man relearned speech using the cadences of birdsong; his Mexican right-hand, Chubb, who was afraid of the dark but a tireless worker and fiercely loyal by day; Father, the county agent, who fought in vain to end overgrazing and protect eagles from his sporting, good-old- boy neighbors; and especially Mother, who died when the narrator was still a girl, but whose limestone-bluff resting place ensured that her presence remained, even as the family dwindled one by one. These ties to the past, binding the mother to the daughter and the daughter to the land, prove more durable than any link with potential mates. In ``The Myths of Bears,'' another Texan, Judith, breaks free of the increasing lunacy of her longtime partner, Trapper, outwitting him and enduring winter in the Alaskan wilderness alone, only to be tripped up later by her concern for him; in ``Where the Sea Used to Be,'' an Alabama man breaks away from his cold-blooded rich boss to show a knack for finding oil from the air that makes him legendary, but also introduces him to a rival passion: Sara. As thoughtful and captivating as his previous work: stories that can only increase Bass's reputation as a writer remarkably able to put people in nature in a way that enhances our understanding of both. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But as followers of Jesus Christ, we face the same call to grow in our faith. So how should we think about and approach Christian education in light of new technologies? Is it possible for us to grow spiritually through our digital communities? Steve Lowe and Mary Lowe, longtime proponents of online education, trace the motif of spiritual growth through Scripture and consider how students and professors alike might foster digital ecologies in which spiritual growth&#x2015;even transformation&#x2015;can take place. <em>IVP Instructor Resources available.</em></p><p>Stephen D.

Building on research in the social sciences, the authors illustrate that digital communities can provide an ecology of spiritual connection and growth. This book is a must-read for educators and administrators who are concerned about Christian formation in a digital age." (Mark A. Maddix, dean of the School of Theology and Christian Ministry, Point Loma Nazarene University, San Diego)<br><br>"When I began teaching seminary in 1996, we offered no online courses or programs; today nearly half of our student course load is online. <em>Ecologies of Faith in a Digital Age</em> provides a much-needed theological framework for those of us trying to understand spirituality in our 'brave new <em>digital</em> world.' I have known Steve and Mary Lowe for about twenty-five years and have watched their thinking blossom and reach maturity; I look forward to learning much from them about the ecology of spiritual formation!" (R. J. Gore Jr., professor of Systematic Theology and Ministry, dean of Erskine Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Online and other forms of distance education are growing rapidly in Christian higher education and leaders and teachers in these settings rightly wonder about the opportunities or loss of opportunities for spiritual formation in these formats. Stephen and Mary Lowe provide us with a thoughtful and challenging 'ecological' model of spiritual growth to consider, exploring its presence in Scripture and potential benefit for thinking about and carrying out online teaching in ways that can promote reciprocal spiritual growth as we are mutually connected with Christ. This book is helping me think in new ways about how we can grow together spiritually, even when we are apart, and it has potential benefit for both Christian higher education and mission and local ministry settings. If you are involved in online teaching or ministry, it's a must-read." (Kevin E. Lawson, professor of educational studies, editor of the Christian Education Journal, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University)<br><br>"Mary Lowe and Stephen Lowe have long been trailblazers in the work of online theological education. In this volume they bring together their passion for spiritual formation, faithful pedagogy, and online learning. Those who doubt if these things can be brought together will find a well-informed, illuminating, and creative apologetic for faith formation in a digital age. Theological educators and students will be challenged, helped, and encouraged by the work of Mary Lowe and Stephen Lowe. It is a privilege to recommend this fine volume." (David S. Dockery, president of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"Theological education is so much bigger than what happens in the classroom. In our increasingly interconnected world we're just now beginning to realize how much that truth impacts every aspect of teaching and learning. Nowhere is that more important than online. This rich resource helps distance educators think about their work less as information download and more as sowers of seed, cultivating and nurturing both soil and plant in a holistic ecosystem of transformative learning."

If your institution is looking into the future of spiritual formation in digital worlds, this book will be instrumental in guiding you." (Lorne Oke, executive director at the Center for Learning and Innovation, Indiana Wesleyan University)<br><br>"In this ubiquitously connected and networked age, Steve Lowe and Mary Lowe have offered a thought provoking, ecological perspective of spiritual formation and how we grow as Christians.

The author teaches readers to think like experimental social psychologists, that is, to use or develop explanatory theories and to manipulate and measure variables in order to explain the origin or purpose of some aspect of social life. It provides information to perform research projects on human social behavior from start to finish, from selecting a research topic to collecting and analyzing data to writing up and the results using the American Psychological Association&#x2019;s required format (i.e., APAstyle). Along the way, they will learn about the particular ethical issues social psychologists face, the logic of experimental design, alternative research approaches, sorting accuracy from error in research, and how to orally present their findings, among other issues. <p>This book contains up-to-date scholarship and emphasizes active learning through pedagogical activities and exercises designed to help students design and execute their own social psychological research.</p></p><p><b>Dana S.

Setting everything in motion is the wily antihero, Chichikov, the trafficker in &#x201c;dead souls&#x201d;&#x2013;deceased serfs who still represent profit to those clever enough to trade in them.<br><br>This lively, idiomatic English version by the award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky makes accessible the full extent of the novel&#x2019;s lyricism, sulphurous humor, and delight in human oddity and error. <br><br></p></p><p>A socially adept newcomer fluidly inserts himself into an unnamed Russian town, conquering first the drinkers, then the dignitaries. All find him amiable, estimable, agreeable. But what exactly is Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov up to?--something that will soon throw the town "into utter perplexity." <p> After more than a week of entertainment and "passing the time, as they say, very pleasantly," he gets down to business--heading off to call on some landowners. More pleasantries ensue before Chichikov reveals his bizarre plan. He'd like to buy the souls of peasants who have died since the last census. The first landowner looks carefully to see if he's mad, but spots no outward signs. In fact, the scheme is innovative but by no means bonkers. Even though Chichikov will be taxed on the supposed serfs, he will be able to count them as his property and gain the reputation of a gentleman owner. His first victim is happy to give up his souls for free--less tax burden for him. The second, however, knows Chichikov must be up to something, and the third has his servants rough him up. Nonetheless, he prospers. </p><p> <i>Dead Souls</i> is a feverish anatomy of Russian society (the book was first published in 1842) and human wiles. Its author tosses off thousands of sublime epigrams--including, "However stupid a fool's words may be, they are sometimes enough to confound an intelligent man," and is equally adept at yearning satire: "Where is he," Gogol interrupts the action, "who, in the native tongue of our Russian soul, could speak to us this all-powerful word: <i>forward</i>? who, knowing all the forces and qualities, and all the depths of our nature, could, by one magic gesture, point the Russian man towards a lofty life?" Flannery O'Connor, another writer of dark genius, declared Gogol "necessary along with the light." Though he was hardly the first to envision property as theft, his blend of comic, fantastic moralism is <i>sui generis</i>.<i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Since its publication in 1842, Dead Souls has been celebrated as a supremely realistic portrait of provincial Russian life and as a splendidly exaggerated tale; as a paean to the Russian spirit and as a remorseless satire of imperial Russian venality, vulgarity, and pomp. As Gogol's wily antihero, Chichikov, combs the back country wheeling and dealing for "dead souls"--deceased serfs who still represent money to anyone sharp enough to trade in them--we are introduced to a Dickensian cast of peasants, landowners, and conniving petty officials, few of whom can resist the seductive illogic of Chichikov's proposition. This lively, idiomatic English version by the award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky makes accessible the full extent of the novel's lyricism, sulphurous humor, and delight in human oddity and error. <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p></p><h2>Approaches to Peace: A Reader in Peace Studies</h2><p><em>Approaches to Peace: A Reader in Peace Studies</em>, Third Edition, provides a unique and interdisciplinary sampling of key articles focusing on the diverse facets of peace and conflict studies.

Hebrews has been deeply appreciated by its readers throughout the centuries-from the first century to the twenty-first century. During the early days of the church, believers from all backgrounds were subject to persecution and pressure to renounce their faith. Vulnerable to doubts about the superiority of Jesus Christ, Jewish believers were tempted to turn back to old Jewish rituals and ways of thinking. The letter to the Hebrews was written to warn Jewish Christians against drifting from faith in Jesus back to their former religious rituals. Though today&#39;s Western Christians may not be enticed by Jewish religious practices, we may feel the tug of materialism, self-promoting individualism, or a former lifestyle. Hebrews speaks to this temptation with the clear message that only Christ brings salvation, only Christ brings forgiveness, and only Christ satisfies. Therefore Christ alone deserves our adoration, worship, and praise.Ray C. Stedman was for many years the pastor of Peninsula Bible Church in Palo Alto, California.

Their deaths were mysteries, until now! Post-Mortem: Solving History&#39;s Great Medical Mysteries by Philip A. Mackowiak, MD, FACP, examines the controversial lives and deaths of 12 famous men and women. Post-Mortem answers vexing questions such as: Was Alexander the Great a victim of West Nile virus? What caused the gruesome final illness of King Herod? Was Joan of Arc mentally ill during her heresy trial? Could syphillis have made Beethoven deaf? Did Edgar Allan Poe drink himself to death? This new book also investigates the mysterious deaths of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten, the Greek statesman and general Pericles, the Roman Emperor Claudius, Christopher Columbus, Mozart, Florence Nightingale, and Booker T. Washington. Post-Mortem traces 3,500 years of medical history from the perspective of what contemporary physicians thought about the diseases of their renowned patients and how they might have treated them. It follows the case history format of today&#39;s clinical pathologic conferences, describing the characteristics of the illnesses in question, and bringing to life the medical history, social history, family history, and physical examination of their famous victims. Post-Mortem then sifts through the medical evidence, testing a wide range of diagnostic theories against the known facts and today&#39;s best scientific research, to arrive at the diagnosis most consistent with the illness described in the historic record.</p><p>Dr. Philip A. Mackowiak is director of medical care at the VA Maryland Health Care System and professor and vice chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He has taught the art of clinical diagnosis to medical students and graduate physicians for over three decades. Post Mortem was inspired by the annual Historical Clinicopathological Conference hosted by Dr. Mackowiak since 1995 for the VA Maryland Health Care System and the University of Maryland School of Medicine.Fascinating...

In The Panic of 1907, authors Robert Bruner and Sean Carr offer an alternate perspective through a detailed narrative of one of the worst crises in modern financial history&#x2014;one which ultimately transformed the American financial system and resulted in the establishment of the modern Federal Reserve.</p> <p>Drawing from rare source materials, Bruner and Carr take you day by day through the crisis in 1907, revealing what happened, why it matters, and what we can learn from it. Beginning with a catastrophic earthquake in San Francisco and culminating in the shocking suicide of the deposed president of one of New York's leading financial institutions, this book will draw you into the central issues surrounding the panic of 1907. Throughout this journey, you'll not only become familiar with the events of the crisis, but you'll also discover how larger-than-life figures, such as the inestimable J.

They offer clear-cut step-by-step guidance to help boys fulfill themselves, use their intelligence, work with their unique natural gifts, expand every bit of their potential, and ultimately succeed in life.</p> <p><b><i>The Minds of Boys</i></b> also presents a scientifically researched, field-tested program for helping boys learn the academic basics: reading, writing, math, and science. Drawing from the latest gender-based brain science and tested by the Gurian Institute and school districts across the United States, Canada, and Australia, the program speaks to specific differences in the way boys and girls learn, the best learning environment for boys' brains, how to help undermotivated and underperforming boys, how to use the arts and athletics to teach boys, how to teach and care for sensitive, aggressive, restless, or bored boys, and how to utilize the option of single-gender education at crucial periods of a son's life.</p> <p><b><i>The Minds of Boys</i></b> emphasizes that our schools cannot fix the problems our boys face without families becoming a centerpiece for the solution. Detailing how parents, extended family, teachers, coaches, and mentors can work together, this proven classroom program can help confront the current crisis in boys' education so that all our sons achieve success in life.</p><p><b>Praise for<i> The Minds of Boys</i></b> </p><p>"Wonderfully readable, <i>The Minds of Boys</i> fills a great void for parents and educators by offering practical ways to change the developmental course for boys at risk.

Yet there is striking disagreement about what liberalism really means and how it arose. In this engrossing history of liberalism&#x2015;the first in English for many decades&#x2015;veteran political observer Edmund Fawcett traces the ideals, successes, and failures of this central political tradition through the lives and ideas of a rich cast of European and American thinkers and politicians, from the early nineteenth century to today.</p><p>Using a broad idea of liberalism, the book discusses celebrated thinkers from Constant and Mill to Berlin, Hayek, and Rawls, as well as more neglected figures. Its twentieth-century politicians include Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Willy Brandt, but also Hoover, Reagan, and Kohl. The story tracks political liberalism from its beginnings in the 1830s to its long, grudging compromise with democracy, through a golden age after 1945 to the present mood of challenge and doubt.</p><p>Focusing on the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, the book traces how the distinct traditions of these countries converged on the practice of liberal democracy. Although liberalism has many currents, Fawcett suggests that they are held together by shared commitments: resistance to power, faith in social progress, respect for people&#x2019;s chosen enterprises and beliefs, and acceptance that interests and faiths will always conflict.</p><p>An enlightening account of a vulnerable but critically important political creed, <i>Liberalism</i> will be a revelation for readers who think they already know&#x2015;for good or ill&#x2015;what liberalism is.</p></p><p>Some words of mine about <i>Liberalism</i>&nbsp;will be in the preface to the paperback later in 2015<p>"In this wonderfully fluent tour through the history of modern liberal thinking, Edmund Fawcett examines a generous selection of important thinkers from the 1830s to our own time in a way that locates both the lineage of their political thinking and the politics of their times. Sharp analysis is combined with a compelling narrative of serious thinkers at work. There is much to learn in this book, which is truly a joy to read. He makes judgments, but they are aids, not substitutes, for our own thinking about liberalism as an idea and about its present possibilities."<b>--Thomas Bender, New York University</b></p><p>"<i>Liberalism: The Life of an Idea</i> possesses both the authority made possible by sustained scholarly research, and the clarity and simplicity found in first-rate journalism. It covers two centuries of the history of a principle guiding political practice and the various philosophies that have attempted to justify or defame it. It is a very timely reminder of the achievements and problems of a political tradition now everywhere under siege."<b>--Gareth Stedman Jones, University of Cambridge and Queen Mary, University of London</b></p><p>"[A] fine work of intellectual history that shows, among much else, that experience can shape ideas, too."<b>--William Anthony Hay</b></p><p>"Elegant, fluently written, and wryly amusing, this enlightening history of liberalism tells a persuasive story of ideas and politics through the lives of a huge variety of characters. The result is tremendously enjoyable."<b>--Duncan Kelly, author of <i>The Propriety of Liberty</i></b></p><p>"This is, quite simply, one of the most lively and engaging books that I've read in some time. With a brisk narrative that holds the reader's attention from start to finish, <i>Liberalism</i> provides a comprehensive survey of the subject, introducing a remarkable diversity of people and ideas, and offering a creative reconsideration of familiar tensions.

The desire to have a reliable protector and steady family companion all in the same dog has encouraged interest in the Schutzhund philosophy. Schutzhund began in nineteenth-century Europe as a test of a dog's ability to work for humans. In the early 1900s. Max von Stephanitz refined and redesigned the tests to include obedience, protection and tracking. <i>Schutzhund: Theory and Training Methods</i>, a superb explanation of Schutzhund and its components, shows how obedience, protection and tracking all play an integral part in training a Schutzhund dog.<p>Authors Barwig and Hilliard emphasize selection and raising of the dog to suit the owner's needs as well as crystallizing the goals and techniques in training for each phase of the process. A unique format guides the reader first through an overview of each component and then into the philosophy and training techniques for all activities.</p><p>Beautifully organized and abundantly illustrated, this book will allow the reader to tailor these training systems to suit individual needs, producing a dog of value to many. <i>Schutzhund: Theory and Training Methods</i> is a volume essential to any obedience or Schutzhund fan's library.</p>Susan Barwig is an award-winning author who has, for several years, been part of the American team in international Schutzhund competition.

Yet today, science and its practitioners have come under political attack. In this fascinating history spanning continents and centuries, historian David Wootton offers a lively defense of science, revealing why the Scientific Revolution was truly the greatest event in our history.</p><p><em>The Invention of Science</em> goes back five hundred years in time to chronicle this crucial transformation, exploring the factors that led to its birth and the people who made it happen. Wootton argues that the Scientific Revolution was actually five separate yet concurrent events that developed independently, but came to intersect and create a new worldview. Here are the brilliant iconoclasts&#x2014;Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton, and many more curious minds from across Europe&#x2014;whose studies of the natural world challenged centuries of religious orthodoxy and ingrained superstition.</p><p>From gunpowder technology, the discovery of the new world, movable type printing, perspective painting, and the telescope to the practice of conducting experiments, the laws of nature, and the concept of the fact, Wotton shows how these discoveries codified into a social construct and a system of knowledge. Ultimately, he makes clear the link between scientific discovery and the rise of industrialization&#x2014;and the birth of the modern world we know.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2015:</strong> Here&#x2019;s a big, fat history of science (spanning from 1572 to 1704) with a very clear thesis: that science, and thus the world, entered the modern age during this precise span. Wooton, the Anniversary Professor of History at the University of York, explores primary texts and detailed history to build his argument that Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s discovery of a new star in 1572 started a scientific revolution, and that Isaac Newton&#x2019;s 1704 publication of <em>Opticks</em> sealed it. What happened in between was a series of discoveries&#x2014;of gunpowder, movable type, the New World, etc.&#x2014;that altered our perception of <em>what is</em> and, through the Newtonian Revolution, opened our minds to <em>what might be</em>. The sheer size of the book allows readers to jump around between essays, but taken as a whole <em>The Invention of Science</em> builds a powerful, thoroughly fascinating argument ripe for debate. --<em>Chris Schluep</em></p><p>Before 1492, all significant knowledge was believed to be already available; there was no concept of progress, as people looked to the past, not the future, for understanding. David Wootton argues that the discovery of America demonstrated new knowledge was possible: indeed, it introduced the very concept of discovery and opened the way to the invention of science.</p><p>The first crucial discovery was Tycho Brahe&#x2019;s nova of 1572: proof that there could be change in the heavens. The invention of the telescope in 1608 rendered the old astronomy obsolete. Evangelista Torricelli&#x2019;s experiment with the vacuum, in 1643 directly led to the triumph of the experimental method used in the Royal Society by Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton. By 1750, Newtonianism was being celebrated throughout Europe.</p><p>This innovative science relied on a new understanding of what knowledge may be, and with this came a fresh language: discovery, progress, fact, experiment, hypothesis, theory, and laws of nature. Although almost all these terms existed before 1492, their meanings were radically transformed, and they became tools to think scientifically. Now we all speak this language of science that was invented during the Scientific Revolution.</p><p>The new culture led to a new rationalism, repudiating alchemy, astrology, and the belief in witchcraft. It also led to the invention of the steam engine and to the first Industrial Revolution. Wootton&#x2019;s landmark work changes our understanding of how this great transformation came about, and of what science is.</p></p><h2>Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History (7th Edition)</h2><p>Normal wear and tear from moderate use.

He's running after the Egyptian movie star, Souad Hosni, who's out there somewhere, miles away from this neighborhood&#x2015;which is a place the teenager both loves and hates, the home at which he is not at home, an environment that will only allow him his identity through the cultural lens of shame and silence. Running is the only way he can stand up to the violence that is his Morocco.</p><p>Irresistibly charming, angry, and wry, this autobiographical novel traces the emergence of Abdellah Ta�a's identity as an openly gay Arab man living between cultures.

M. de Medeiros, University of Kent at Canterbury. A year after the publication of &#34;The Three Musketeers&#34;, Alexandre Dumas produced a sequel worthy in every respect of the original. In &#34;Twenty Years After&#34; the much beloved D&#39;Artaganan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reunite to fight the forces of evil. In the original novel they defeated Milady, a formidable foe; now they need to face her vengeful son Mordaunt, as well as countering the machinations of the sinister Cardinal Mazarin. Their adventures also take them to England, where Cromwell is about to topple Charles I. Meanwhile, they must overcome the obstacles which the passing of time has placed between them. Rediscovering strength in unity, they fight for Queen and country. &#34;The Musketeer&#34; novels were a huge success in Dumas&#39; own lifetime, and have lost none of their original appeal. Translated into many languages and adapted for cinema and television, they have helped to make Dumas arguably the most successful exporter of French culture to the wider world.</p><p></p><h2>No Go, the Bogeyman: Scaring, Lulling, and Making Mock</h2><p>An exciting new work, richly illustrated, on the age-old images and stories about frightening men.<br><br>In this provocative new work, Marina Warner goes beyond the terrain she covered in her widely praised <i>From the Beast to the Blonde</i>. She explores the darker, wilder realm where ogres and giants devour children, where bogeymen haunt the night and each of us must face our bugaboos. No Go the Bogeyman considers the enduring presence and popularity of figures of male terror, establishing their origins in mythology and their current relation to ideas about sexuality and power, youth and age.<br><br>Songs, stories, images, and films about frightening monsters have always been invented to allay the very terrors that our dreams of reason conjure up. Warner shows how these images and stories, while they may unfold along different lines--scaring, lulling, or making mock-always have the strategic, simultaneous purpose of both arousing and controlling the underlying fear. In a brilliant analysis of material long overlooked by cultural critics, historians, and even psychologists, Warner revises our understanding of storytelling in contemporary culture, of masculine identity, racial stereotyping, and the dangerous, unthinking ways we perpetuate the bogeyman.<br></p><p>Having previously examined the role of women in fairy tales in <i>From the Beast to the Blonde</i>, Marina Warner now sets out on an equally eclectic study that was originally supposed to be about men, but instead became a treatise on the grotesque. Taking on everything from Zeus to Bluebeard, from Punch to the Teletubbies, she examines the ways in which we give voice to our fears in order to master--and even mock--them. In that light, her sections on the modern cultural transformation of children themselves into "little monsters" should prove quite interesting to readers of Joseph Campbell and other scholars who take erudite approaches to pop and folk culture.<b>Marina Warner</b> is the author of novels and short stories as well as works of nonfiction. Her most recent books include<i> From the Beast to the Blonde</i> (FSG, 1995) and <i>Wonder Tales </i>(FSG, 1996). She lives in London.<br></p><h2>Preaching God&#39;s Transforming Justice: A Lectionary Commentary, Year A</h2><p><p>This is the final volume in a unique new commentary series that helps the preacher identify and reflect on the social implications of the biblical readings in the Revised Common Lectionary. The essays concentrate on the themes of social justice in the weekly texts and how those themes can be teachable moments for preaching social justice in the church.</p><p>In addition to the lectionary days, there are essays for twenty-two "Holy Days of Justice," including Martin Luther King Day, Earth Day, World AIDS Day, and Children's Sabbath. These days are intended to enlarge the church's awareness of God's call for justice and of the many ways that call comes to the church and world today.</p></p><p><p><b>Ronald J.

They seem to belong to no time, or to some distant feudal age of fairytale imagining.

Influential in introducing Japanese print techniques to the United States, these artists began to pursue a new method of printing from a single block, and invented a technique known as the white-line woodcut. Through her studies in Paris with Fernand Leger and Albert Gleizes, one of the chief exponents of Cubism, and her passion for French Modernism, Lazzell brought a modern flair to her prints--and, along with Georgia O&#39;Keefe, was one of the first American women artists to work in a Modernist style. Tracing her career in Europe and America, and offering a selection of her woodblocks, drawings, paintings, ceramics, and hooked rugs, this book tells the story of Lazzell and the remarkably innovative circle of which she was a part. From Paris to Provincetown is the most comprehensive volume ever published on this influential yet little-known artist.</p><p>Barbara Stern Shapiro is Curator for Special Projects at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Focusing on the youth-driven phenomenon of <i>otaku (</i>roughly translated as geek culture&#x201d; or pop cult fanaticism&#x201d;), Takashi Murakami and a notable group of contributors explore the complex historical influences that shape Japanese contemporary art and its distinct graphic languages. The book&#x2019;s title, <i>Little Boy, </i>is a reference to the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, thus clearly locating the birth of these new cultural forms in the trauma and generational aftershock of the atomic bomb.<br><br>This generously illustrated book showcases the work of key otaku artists and designers, many of whom are cult celebrities in Japan, and discusses their feature film and video animations, video games and internet sites, music, toys, fashion, and more. In the process, the following questions are posed: What is otaku, and what does it tell us about contemporary social, economic, and cultural life in Japan and throughout the world? How is it related to the pervasive and curious fixation on cuteness&#x201d; evident in Japanese popular culture? What impact did the atomic devastation of World War II have on the development of Japanese art and culture?<br><br>This brilliantly designed, bilingual (English and Japanese) publication examines these themes to explore how contemporary Japanese art has become inseparable from the subcultural realms of manga and anim� (Japanese animation) a world where meticulous technique, apocalyptic imagery, and high and low cultures meet.<br><br><i>Little Boy concludes </i>Murakami&#x2019;s Superflat&#x201d; trilogy, a project conceived in 2000 to introduce a new wave of Japanese artists and to place their work in the historical context of traditional styles and concepts.<br><br></p><p><p><i>Little Boy </i>explores<i> </i>contemporary Japanese popular culture from the unique perspective of one of the country&#x2019;s most celebrated artists.

Proudly dubbed &#x201c;an entirely synthetic fish&#x201d; by fisheries managers, the rainbow trout has been introduced into every state and province in the United States and Canada and to every continent except Antarctica, often with devastating effects on the native fauna. Halverson examines the paradoxes and reveals a range of characters, from nineteenth-century boosters who believed rainbows could be the saviors of democracy to twenty-first-century biologists who now seek to eradicate them from waters around the globe. Ultimately, the story of the rainbow trout is the story of our relationship with the natural world&#x2014;how it has changed and how it startlingly has not.</p></p><p><b>Anders Halverson</b> is a journalist with a Ph.D. in aquatic ecology from Yale University.

The traditional way of teaching comparative economics, with its reliance on relatively simple dichotomies (private vs. state, planning vs. market) does not take into consideration the many variants and mixtures of economic systems that exist in the real world. The Rossers' introduction in the first edition of the concept of the "new traditional economy"&#x2015;the effort by a developing country to embed a modern economic system into a traditional culture, usually religious&#x2015;presented a new way to look at developing economies. Their innovative examination of Iran and its effort to develop a "revolutionary Islamic economy" as an alternative to market capitalism illustrates the use of this new tool in comparative economics.</p><p>After a four-chapter theoretical and historical overview, the book focuses on fifteen country studies, organized by economic system. The chapters on advanced market capitalism examine the economies of the United States (a chapter new to this edition) Japan, France, Sweden, and Germany. The chapters examining transition in former socialist economies discuss Russia, the former Soviet Republics, Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia (including expanded treatment of the most successful transition economy, that of Slovenia), and China. The chapters in the final section of the book discuss "alternative paths" taken by the developing economies of Iran, India (its complex mix of socialism, capitalism, and tradition is examined in a chapter new to this edition), Mexico, and South and North Korea. The book concludes with a look at future trends that will continue to transform the world economy.</p></p><p>"Rosser and Rosser&#x2019;s wide ranging book provides an engrossing and up-to-date introduction, not just to capitalism and socialism in their various forms, but also to the 'new traditionalism,' as found in such countries as Iran. Their emphasis on the political and religious factors complementing particular economic forces in shaping economic institutions is particularly insightful." --Frederic L. Pryor, Senior Research Scholar, Swarthmore College <p>"With the fall of Soviet Union, the cold war debate on socialism vs. capitalism is out, and the discourse on the systemic approach to public policy is in. Barkley and Marina Rosser's presentation of the mosaic of world economic systems is theoretically rigorous and factually interesting. It challenges students analytically and offers them a new vantage point for examining the complexities of our societies. It is an attractive textbook, and a good read!" --Sohrab Behdad, Professor and John E. Harris Chair in Economics, Denison University </p><p>"With the collapse of communism, economics has struggled to redefine itself and find a new direction. In this book the Rossers push for an economics that is exceedingly relevant for understanding the ongoing changes in the global economy. They weave together theory and history to explain socialism's origins, inner workings, collapse, and transformation, as well as alternative paths in Western Europe and Asia. I highly recommend this book for undergraduate and graduate courses in comparative economic systems and political economy." --Peter J. Boettke, Deputy Director, James M. Buchanan Center for Political Economy, George Mason University </p><p>"This text is an outstanding achievement in a field that has been in flux since the epochal changes in Russia and Eastern Europe. The authors demonstrate the continuing relevance of the comparative-systems approach by illustrating the extraordinary diversity in contemporary societies, from the market socialism of China to the worker-managed socialism of Slovenia to the new social arrangements in 'traditional' societies such as Iran. This is an important text that greatly improves the choices for systems courses." --Satyananda J. Gabriel, Department of Economics, Mount Holyoke College</p>J.

(1908)</p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesA Room With a View portrays the love of a British woman for an expatriate living in Italy, a country which to Forster represents the forces of true passion. Caught up in a world of social snobbery, Forster's heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, finds herself constrained by the claustrophobic influence of her British guardians, who encourage her to take up with a well-connected boor. When she regrets that her hotel room has no view, a member of the lower class offers to trade rooms with her. Lucy becomes caught in a struggle between her own emotions and social conventions. In the end, however, Lucy takes control of her own fate and finds love with a man whose free spirit reminds her of a "room with a view".<p>There are some writers whose work is especially suitable for out-loud reading and E.M.

Like other religions in the United States, it has witnessed a decline in the number of participants over the past forty years, and many who remain active struggle to reconcile their hallowed traditions with new perspectives&#x2015;from feminism and the LGBTQ movement to &#x201c;do-it-yourself religion&#x201d; and personally defined spirituality. Taking a fresh look at American Judaism today, Jack Wertheimer, a leading authority on the subject, sets out to discover how Jews of various orientations practice their religion in this radically altered landscape. Which observances still resonate, and which ones have been given new meaning? What options are available for seekers or those dissatisfied with conventional forms of Judaism? And how are synagogues responding?</p><p>Wertheimer provides new and often-surprising answers to these questions by drawing on a wide range of sources, including survey data, visits to countless synagogues, and revealing interviews with more than two hundred rabbis and other informed observers. He finds that the majority of American Jews still identify with their faith but often practice it on their own terms. Meanwhile, gender barriers are loosening within religiously traditional communities, while some of the most progressive sectors are reappropriating long-discarded practices. Other recent developments include &#x201c;start-ups&#x201d; led by charismatic young rabbis, the explosive growth of Orthodox &#x201c;outreach,&#x201d; and unconventional worship experiences often geared toward millennials.</p><p>Wertheimer captures the remarkable, if at times jarring, tableaux on display when American Jews practice their religion, while also revealing possibilities for significant renewal in American Judaism. What emerges is a quintessentially American story of rash disruption and creative reinvention, religious illiteracy and dynamic experimentation.</p></p><p><b>Jack Wertheimer </b>is professor of American Jewish history at the Jewish Theological Seminary. His many books include <i>The New Jewish Leaders: Reshaping the American Jewish Landscape</i>, <i>Family Matters: Jewish Education in an Age of Choice</i>, and <i>A People Divided: Judaism in Contemporary America</i>.&#x201c;In this unflinching, sweeping look at the lived religion of diverse Jewish Americans, Jack Wertheimer documents broad patterns and telling details to reveal extensive swathes of &#x2018;minimalistic and enervated Judaism&#x2019; as well as bright instances of vitality. And his concluding manifesto&#x2015;a moving plea and powerful prescription for a flourishing, quotidian Judaism&#x2015;should inform serious discussions about religious life today.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Sylvia Barack Fishman, Brandeis University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Jack Wertheimer provides an up-to-date picture of American Judaism that takes into account twenty-first-century developments.

In reading Madame Bovary, one experiences a work that remains genuinely revolutionary almost a century and a half after its creation.&#34;Madame Bovary is like the railroad stations erected in its epoch: graceful, even floral, but cast of iron.&#34; -- John Updike</p><h2>Focusing-Oriented Psychotherapy: A Manual of the Experiential Method (The Practicing Professional)</h2><p>Examining the actual moment-to-moment process of therapy, this volume provides specific ways for therapists to engender effective movement, particularly in those difficult times when nothing seems to be happening.

The unique perspective of this text was created specifically with the student in mind and focuses on being reader-friendly and paralegal centered. There is a strong emphasis on the role of the paralegal in helping to create different business organizations, and the focus is on building a strong foundation on theory followed up with reinforcing practical examples and applications. The text explores the basic concepts of business from sole proprietorships to corporations, and also addresses some of the more mystifying concepts such as shareholder agreements and the business judgment rule. There are learning objectives at the beginning of each chapter to clarify the goal of the chapter, and important terms are bolded and defined upon first use in order to highlight legal terminology. Ethical blocks were created to encourage discussion of ethical issues throughout the text, and there are many case excerpts included to lead to a more thorough exploration of business law issues. Not only are the various models of business organizations explored, but also the critical role played by the paralegal and the legal team in creating and maintaining those organizations. This along with a clear balance between theory and application, as well as multiple learning tools, makes Business Organizations and Corporate Law the ideal text and reference.</p><p>Neal R.

Victorious in the Battles of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), and countless other campaigns, Marlborough, whose political intrigues were almost as legendary as his military skill, never fought a battle he didn't win. Although he helped James II crush the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, Marlborough later supported William of Orange against James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and brilliantly managed England's diplomatic triumphs during the War of the Spanish Succession. Marlborough also bequeathed the world another great British military strategist and diplomat&#x2014;his descendant, Winston S. Churchill, who wrote this book to redeem Marlborough's reputation from Macaulay's smears.<br><br>One million words long and ten years in the making, Churchill's <i>Marlborough</i> stands as both a literary and historical masterpiece, giving us unique insights into the Churchill of World War II, for just as Churchill's literary skill helps us understand the complexities of Marlborough's life, so too did his writing of Marlborough help Churchill master the arts of military strategy and diplomacy. This two-volume edition includes the entire text and almost all the original maps.</p><p>One of the most famous political figures of the twentieth century, <b>Sir Winston S. Churchill</b> (1874-1965) was also a well-known historian, biographer, and writer. Among his many books are <i>A History of the English-Speaking Peoples</i> (in four volumes), <i>The World Crisis, 1916-1918</i> (two volumes), and <i>The Second World War</i> (six volumes).&#34;The greatest historical work written in our century, an inexhaustible mine of political wisdom and understanding, which should be required reading for every student of political science.&#34; - Leo Strauss, University of Chicago &#34;Rarely in the history of historical writing have author and subject seemed so made for each other.&#34; - Henry Steele Commager</p><h2>Tales of Mystery &amp; Macabre (Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural)</h2><p>In the great mirror opposite I saw myself, and right behind, another wicked fearful self, so like me my soul seemed to quiver within me, as though not knowing to which similitude of body it belonged... Elizabeth Gaskell is better known today for her pioneering social novels such as Mary Barton (1848) but she also wrote some fascinating tales of the supernatural and the macabre, which are collected here in this volume. The real charm of this dark anthology is its variety. Unlike so many writers of this kind of material, Gaskell allows the story to fit the style rather than the other way around and as result there is a charming freshness to each tale. This remarkable author uses different voices, tones and topics to engage her readers and as you turn from one story to the next you cannot be quite sure what to expect.</p><p>Along with short stories and a biography of Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) published five more novels including "Wives and Daughters" (1865).<br><br>An internationally recognized expert on Sherlock Holmes and Conan Doyle, David Stuart Davies is the editor of the crime fiction magazine "Sherlock" and the author of several books on Sherlock Holmes.

The Viking Age was a period of major change as a result of the Vikings&#x2019; impact on neighboring areas and the introduction of external influences into Scandinavia. This book explores Viking culture from a global perspective, examining the influences of their varied contacts from around the world and how Viking Scandinavia drew from both Christian Europe and the Islamic world.</p><p>The book focuses on the core period of the Viking Age, from the late eighth to the early eleventh centuries. New discoveries by archaeologists and metal detectorists highlight the interconnected nature of the cultures of Europe, Byzantium, and the Middle East.</p><p><em>Vikings</em> accompanies a major exhibition developed jointly by the British Museum, the National Museum of Denmark, and the Museum for Prehistory and Early History in Berlin. Edited by the exhibition curators Gareth Williams, Peter Pentz, and Matthias Wemhoff and with contributions from a number of key experts, the book, with its strong, flowing narrative and integrated illustrations, draws on a wealth of Viking objects to provide a rich and vivid account of the impact of Viking expansion throughout the world.</p></p><p><p> Gareth Williams is Curator of Early Medieval Coins at the British Museum.</p><p>"The book and the exhibition are visually stunning. . . . and the section on 'Belief and Ritual' is fascinating."&#x2015;Tom Shippey, <em>London Review of Books</em></p><br><br><p>"Much more than simply a lavish catalog to accompany the exhibition of the same name organized by the National Museum of Denmark, the British Museum, and the Museum f�r Vor- und Fr�hgeschichte, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin... this attractive, well-produced volume addresses a comprehensive array of subjects relevant to understanding the material and thought worlds of the Viking Age in northern Europe (roughly AD 750-1150)."&#x2015;Stephen Mitchell, <em>Speculum</em> (October 2015)</p><br><br><p>"A beautiful, accessible book, with strong interpretive narration that will be enjoyed by Viking enthusiasts, medievalists, artists interested in material culture, and newcomers to the subject."&#x2015;<em>Library Journal</em> (starred review)</p><br><br>"This volume was written to accompany an exhibition organized by the national museums of Britain, Denmark, and Germany. . . .

It shows how fluency prevailed over other translation strategies to shape the canon of foreign literatures in English, and investigates the cultural consequences of the domestic values which were simultaneously inscribed and masked in foreign texts during this period. Venuti locates alternative translation theories and practices in British, American and European cultures which aim to communicate linguistic and cultural differences instead of removing them. </p> <p>The first edition, now ten years old, is still widely cited by academics in many disciplines and has had a huge influence on the whole field of Translation Studies.&nbsp; A new edition offers Venuti the chance to keep this influence alive, updating and advancing his argument and&nbsp;answering his (few) critics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><strong>Lawrence Venut</strong>i is Professor of English at Temple University and has taught in Rome and Barcelona. He has an international following and is one of the leading theorists of cultural approaches to translation.<strong>'Starting with the English translations of Catullus and concluding with the translations created by Robert Lowell and Zukofsky, Venuti tries to show how the theory and practice of translating literary works has been enacted throughout the centuries.'</strong> - <em>World Literature Today</em><br><br><strong>' ... Lawrence Venuti's prose is generally natural, idiomatic and precise. Fluent, even.'</strong> - <em>Times Literary Supplement</em></p><h2>Heidi (World Classics, Unabridged)</h2><p><p>The story of Heidi was written over one hundred years ago, however, it is far from a period piece.

Her presence makes us happy, and so her story has endured.</p></p><p></p><h2>LINKing Authentic Assessment and Early Childhood Intervention: Best Measures for Best Practices, Second Edition</h2><p>How can early childhood professionals make informed decisions while selecting assessment materials that meet recommended practices?

This concise handbook shows future teachers how to teach phonics while, at the same time, &#x201c;filling in the gaps&#x201d; in their personal knowledge of the subject. <b> </b> Coverage is focused on <i>decoding,</i> the lynchpin skill in literacy development. Part I addresses the relationship between phonics and literacy, and provides a six-chapter tutorial that will test the reader's own level of skill. In Part Two, dozens of classroom activities are arranged in the order in which research has shown phonics knowledge to be acquired. New coverage includes <i>Onsets and Rimes</i>&#x2014;addressing common phonemic combinations; Numerous fresh, engaging phonics activities that reflect the latest research in the field. <b> </b> For prospective early childhood reading teachers. </p></p><p><p> <b> <i>J. Lloyd Eldredge</i></b><i> </i> is a professor in the College of Education at the Brigham Young University, where he teaches both graduate and undergraduate literacy courses. </p> <p> Dr. Eldredge is a former elementary school teacher, school principal, and school superintendent. He has also served as the Utah Director of Chapter I, the Utah Director of Early Childhood Education, and the Utah Director of Elementary Education. </p> <p> During the past 18 years his research has been focused on phonemic awareness, phonics, a reconceptualization of decoding instruction in the early years of schooling, whole language, oral reading, and the effects of various forms of "assisted reading" strategies (dyad reading, group assisted reading, and taped assisted reading) on young and "at risk" readers. His work is published in such journals as <i>Journal of Educational Research, Reading Research and Instruction, Journal of Reading, The Reading Teacher, Journal of Literacy Research,</i> and <i>Reading Research Quarterly.</i> He is the author of two books on phonics and decoding: <i>Decoding Strategies</i> and <i>Teaching Decoding in Holistic Classrooms.</i> </p><p> Reading and writing are complex processes requiring a variety of knowledge sources and thinking abilities. For effective reading and writing, individuals need a working knowledge of encoding/decoding, vocabulary, syntax, anaphora, prosody, and text structure. They need to have experiences with the world in which they live&#x2014;experiences stored in the brain and used as they construct meaning during the reading and writing process. </p> <p> Reading involves the ability to translate written language into spoken language (decoding), and writing involves the ability to represent spoken language with the symbols designated for that purpose (encoding). Writers select appropriate words (vocabulary/ schemata), use appropriate punctuation (prosodic features of print), use appropriate sentence patterns (syntax), organize their sentences in some cohesive fashion (anaphora), and organize the entire text in some meaningful way (text structure) to communicate their ideas to readers. Readers use their schemata, vocabulary, prosody, syntax, anaphora, and text structure knowledge to help them understand what writers are trying to communicate. In other words, writers need specific knowledge sources to be able to connect important ideas between sentences and larger units of text, and readers need those same knowledge sources to be able to perceive those idea relationships. </p> <p> Furthermore, both readers and writers must be able to think. Effective writers use their thinking abilities to entertain, teach, and create visual images from written words. Effective readers use their thinking abilities to read between the lines, perceive relationships among ideas, create their own visual images, and critically evaluate the messages writers create. </p> <p> Reading is a process involving much more than decoding. However, without the ability to translate the written language into spoken language, readers could not "read." Without the ability to decode, individuals could not access the knowledge sources and thinking abilities needed to construct meaning from written text. In short, the knowledge sources used by readers to engage in literal, inferential, and critical reading are dependent on their ability to decode. Decoding knowledge, therefore, is a critical component in the reading process. </p> <p> The focus of this text is decoding. The major portion of this book is organized as a self-instruction text to help you understand phonics and its role in the enhancement of decoding processes and overall reading growth. Phonics knowledge is needed for the identification of words both by analogy and context. It is also necessary for "sounding out" both single-syllable and multisyllabic words, and for identifying words by morphemic analysis. Furthermore, existing research reveals that phonics knowledge is needed for extensive word recognition. Since word recognition is necessary for reading fluency, and reading fluency is essential for reading comprehension, phonics knowledge is extremely important. </p> <p> The latter portion of this book is devoted to phonics teaching. In this portion of the book, you will be introduced to teaching activities that direct children's attention toward written words so they can discover how speech sounds are mapped onto print. These activities are designed to help children learn strategies for identifying written words they don't recognize and, in the process, enhance their word recognition abilities. </p> <p> This text can be used in college courses, in-service workshops, and independently by individuals who wish to improve their understanding and use of phonics. </p></p><h2>The Pain Journal (Native Agents)</h2><p>Flanagan&#39;s last finished work, is an extraordinary chronicle of the final year of his life before his death from cystic fibrosis at the age of forty-three.</p><p></p><h2>Visualizing Earth Science</h2><p><i>Visualizing Earth Science</i> relies heavily on the rich visuals to expand on concepts for students and solidify their understanding of them.

Craske discusses the history, theory, and practice of this commonly practiced therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy originated in the science and theory of classical and instrumental conditioning; cognitive principles were incorporated following dissatisfaction with a strictly behavioral approach. Cognitive behavioral therapy combines behavioral and cognitive interventions: behavioral interventions aim to decrease maladaptive behaviors and increase adaptive ones, and cognitive interventions aim to modify maladaptive thoughts, self-statements, or beliefs. Although a number of variations on the original theory have developed over the decades, all types of cognitive behavioral therapy are unified by their empirical foundation, reliance on the theory and science of behavior and cognition, and the centrality of problem-focused goals. In this book, the author presents and explores this approach, its theory, history, the therapy process, primary change mechanisms, empirical basis, and future developments. This essential primer to cognitive behavioral therapy, amply illustrated with case examples featuring diverse clients, is perfect for graduate students studying theories of therapy and counseling as well as for seasoned practitioners interested in understanding this approach.</p><p>In this revised edition of <i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</i>, Michelle G. Craske provides vital updated coverage of the literature that explores the theory, history, therapy process, primary change mechanisms, and empirical basis of the approach, as well as likely future developments. This essential primer to cognitive behavioral therapy, amply illustrated with case examples featuring diverse clients, is perfect for graduate students studying theories of therapy and counseling as well as for seasoned practitioners interested in better understanding this approach.<br> &nbsp;<b>Michelle G.

It takes the form of a broad movement away from classical psychoanalytic theorizing grounded in Freud's drive theory toward models of mind and development grounded in object relations concepts. In clinical practice, there has been a corresponding movement away from the classical principles of neutrality, abstinence and anonymity toward an interactive vision of the analytic situation that places the analytic relationship, with its powerful, reciprocal affective currents, in the foreground. These developments have been evident in virtually all schools of psychoanalysis in America, from the most traditional to the most radical.</p> <p>The wellspring of these innovations is the work of a group of psychoanalysts who have struggled to integrate aspects of interpersonal psychoanalysis, various British object relations theories, and psychoanalytic feminism. Although not self-selected as a school, these theorists have generated a distinct tradition of psychoanalytic thought and clinical practice that has become extremely influential within psychoanalysis in the United States.</p> <p><em>Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition</em> brings together for the first time the seminal papers of the major authors within this tradition. Each paper is accompanied by an introduction, in which the editors place it in its historical context, and a new afterward, in which the author suggests subsequent developments in his or her thinking. This book is an invaluable resource for any clinical practitioner, teacher or student of psychoanalysis interested in exploring the exciting developments of recent years.</p></p><p></p><h2>Jefferson vs. Hamilton: Confrontations that Shaped a Nation (Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p>Interweaving more than 40 documents, <em>Jefferson vs. Hamilton</em> follows the lives and careers each man from their youth, through the Revolutionary War, to the death of Hamilton in 1804, focusing on their differing views of society and government in the formative years of the new American nation.</p><p><b>NOBLE E. CUNNINGHAM JR.</b> is Curators' Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Missouri, Columbia. With research and writing focused on the early national period of American history, his writings include <i>In Pursuit of Reason: The Life of Thomas Jefferson</i> (1987), <i>The Process of Government under Jefferson</i> (1976), <i>The Image of Thomas Jefferson in the Public Eye</i> (1981), <i>Popular Images of the Presidency from Washington to Lincoln</i> (1991), and <i>The Presidency of James Monroe</i> (1996). He has been a Guggenheim Fellow and a senior fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities.Selections from the writings of two of the foremost antagonists among the Founding Fathers, edited and explained by historian and biographer Cunningham (In Pursuit of Reason, 1987). Cunningham's efforts will forever dispel any romantic notions that the Founding Fathers were a troop of amiable Boy Scouts. The Jefferson and Hamilton on display here are fierce opponents, each absolutely convinced that the other was a danger to the fledgling country. Cunningham has juxtaposed some of the principal writings of both men (most of the pieces are excerpts) and supplied some genial commentary--all intended to reveal how the two leading political figures faced the major issues of their day. Hamilton (younger than Jefferson by 12 years) did not trust the general public: The people are turbulent and changing, he wrote in 1787, they seldom judge or determine right. Jefferson, by contrast, had supreme faith in the electorate and wished to guarantee the survival of liberty by improving the education of the common people. Cunningham reveals that there is no record of the first meeting between the men, but they both were members of Washington's first cabinet--Jefferson was Secretary of State, and Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury. Their first important clash was over the formation of the national bank (Hamilton favored it--and won). Jefferson hated Hamilton's fondness for paper currency and later wrote Washington that he believed he had been duped by Hamilton and made a tool for forwarding his schemes. Hamilton later called Jefferson a contemptible hypocrite and could not bring himself to credit Jefferson even for Louisiana, whose purchase, sniped Hamilton, was due to fortuitous . . . circumstances rather than any wise or vigorous measure. Cunningham concludes--somewhat superfluously--that both men contributed greatly to the shaping of the American nation. As this useful volume of powerful prose ably illustrates, what often survives a political collision is moral clarity. (10 illustrations) -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Creativity is woven into the very fabric of our humanity. Therefore, Christians should value and champion creativity as a vital part of our image-bearing role. Instead Christians often don&#x2019;t know what to do with creatives and creatives don&#x2019;t know what to do with Christianity.

Far from it. God is the creator of creativity. He made you creative. This is why your creativity needs theology and why your theology needs creativity. If we really want to know and practice creativity to its fullest, we should begin where creativity begins.

Cassell centers his discussion on the problem of suffering because, he says, its recognition and relief are a test of the adequacy of any system of medicine. He describes what suffering is and its relationship to the sick person: bodies do not suffer, people do. An exclusive concern with scientific knowledge of the body and disease, therefore, impedes an understanding of suffering and diminishes the care of the suffering patient.<br> The growing criticism that medicine is not sufficiently humanistic does not go deep enough to provide a basis for a new understanding of medicine. New concepts in medicine must have their basis in its history and in the development of ideas about disease and treatment. Cassell uses many stories about patients to demonstrate that, despite the current dominance of science and technology, there can be no diagnosis, search for the cause of the patient's disease, prognostication, or treatment without consideration of the individual sick person. Recent trends in medicine and society, Cassell believes, show that it is time for the sick person to be not merely an important concern for physicians but the central focus of medicine. He addresses the exciting problems involved in such a shift. In this new medicine, doctors would have to know the person as well as they know the disease. What are persons, however, and how are doctors to comprehend them? The kinds of knowledge involved are varied, including values and aesthetics as well as science. In the process of knowing the experience of patient and doctor move to center stage. He believes that the exploration of the person will engage medicine in the 21st century just as understanding the body has occupied the last hundred years.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Eric J.

When the tide is high, waves can sweep over plants and animals at velocities as high as 60 miles per hour, while at low tide, the same organisms dry up and bake in the sun. Yet despite this seeming inhospitality, tidepools and rocky shores are exceptionally complex and biologically diverse. This comprehensive encyclopedia is an authoritative, one-stop reference for everyone interested in the biology and ecology of this fascinating and uniquely accessible environment. Conveniently arranged alphabetically, nearly 200 wide-ranging entries written in clear language by scientists from around the world provide a state-of-the-art picture of tidepools and rocky shore science. From Abalones, Barnacles, and Climate Change through Seagrasses, Tides, and Wind, the articles discuss the animals and plants that live in tidepools, the physics and chemistry of the rocky shore environment, the ecological principles that govern tidepools, and many other interdisciplinary topics. <br><br>* Generously illustrated with hundreds of color photographs, drawings, and diagrams <br><br>* The only comprehensive volume available on tidepools and rocky shores <br><br>* Articles include in-depth looks at animal and algal diversity and overviews of the history of research, rocky shore management, and conservation <br><br>* Contributors are experts on physics and physical oceanography, experimental ecology, population genetics, taxonomy, and other disciplines</p><p>"This is the book I have been waiting for! Written by experts in each field, this encyclopedia provides a wealth of information not only about the tidepool and shore life but also the oceanography associated with these habitats. This will be a major reference guide for years to come."&#x2015;Dr. Nigella Hillgarth, Executive Director, Birch Aquarium at Scripps, Scripps Institution of Oceanography<br><br>"The <i>Encyclopedia of Tidepools and Rocky Shores</i> covers much more than one might guess. It ranges from oceanography, to physiology, biomechanics, and conservation science, along with the expected treatment of the diverse groups of organisms that live in those habitats. The coverage of each topic is kept short and comprehensible to almost everyone, from high schools to colleges, and certainly to the general public interested in learning more about this fascinating part of our natural world. Best of all, the editors have managed to get some of the best scientists in the world, the absolute experts in their fields, to write the articles. The relatively short length of each entry also makes this book an ideal source for assigned readings to accompany marine biology, ecology, or oceanography classes, laboratories and field trips. It will be much appreciated by teachers and students."&#x2015;Ken Sebens, Director of the Friday Harbor Marine Laboratories, University of Washington<br><br>"The place where vast oceans meet the land is wondrous, complex and fascinating. Visitors from research scientists to toddlers have explored these ecosystems&#x2015;one of nature's most popular theme parks. Anyone who has spent time amongst the sea stars, crabs and kelp departs full of unanswered questions. Now these questions can be answered by dipping into the <i>Encyclopedia of Tidepools and Rocky Shores</i>. The editors and contributors to this reference have created a new standard that will be an immediate classic."&#x2015;Leon Panetta, Director, The Leon &amp; Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy<br><br>"This volume is a wonderful introduction to the hidden and fascinating world of rocky tidepools. Grab a copy and head out with your kids or students for an outdoor experience that's sure to get them hooked. From remarkable adaptations of marine algae to weird animal life histories, tidepools hold amazing stories to tell. They deserve our interest&#x2015;and our care&#x2015;as part of earth's natural systems that sustain us all."&#x2015;Julie Packard, Executive Director, Monterey Bay Aquarium<br><br>"Tide pool lovers the world around will satisfy their curiosity, uncover new gems of insight and renew their wonder of nature at lands' end in this authoritative, fascinating and insightful compilation. Revealed within are the secrets of rocky shores and tide pools&#x2015;that most dynamic of interfaces between the land and the sea, that treasure chest of rich biodiversity and keen insight, that world where science, literature, beauty and stewardship combine to form the now that integrates the past and tempts the future."&#x2015;Jane Lubchenco, Oregon State University<b>Mark W.

It answers these essential questions: <br>- Is it high expectations for students that matter?<br>- How do great teachers respond when students misbehave?<br>- Do great teachers filter differently than their peers?<br>- How do the best teachers approach standardized testing?<br> - How can your teachers gain the same advantages?</p><p>One of the nation&#x2019;s leading authorities on motivation, teacher leadership, and principal effectiveness, Todd Whitaker is a former middle and high school teacher and principal, now a professor at Indiana State University.</p><h2>Atomic Physics (Oxford Master Series in Physics)</h2><p>This text will thoroughly update the existing literature on atomic physics. Intended to accompany an advanced undergraduate course in atomic physics, the book will lead the students up to the latest advances and the applications to Bose-Einstein Condensation of atoms, matter-wave inter-ferometry and quantum computing with trapped ions. The elementary atomic physics covered in the early chapters should be accessible to undergraduates when they are first introduced to the subject. To complement the usual quantum mechanical treatment of atomic structure the book strongly emphasizes the experimental basis of the subject, especially in the later chapters. It includes ample tutorial material (examples, illustrations, chapter summaries, graded problem sets).<br></p><p>C.J.

Well, if he had lived to read this book he would be eating those very mean words. Cher had many first times in her life, and she puts them all down on paper here. For example, Cher shares her thoughts on politics in the section entitled "My First Allergic Reaction to Republicans." Here, she comments that Jackie Kennedy was much better looking than Mamie Eisenhower. How could anyone vote for Nixon, wonders Cher, when he was so "creepy" and his wife was "pinchy-faced"? But Cher thinks about more than just politics. There's also the first time she had sex with an Italian, the first time she had sex with a "bad boy" and the first time she had sex with a "mook." Cher even has something to say about clothing. If you're looking for a book that's hard to read, look elsewhere, but if you want the inside scoop on the depths of Cher's thoughts, served up in one-page essays, this is the book for you. <i>--James DiGiovanna</i>A collection of short, easily digestible anecdotesof her first Rolling Stones concert, her first solo recording, her first wedding ceremonytold by Cher and committed to paper in a tone of talkiness that seems to come straight from the tape recorder. Each brief recollection, some not more than a paragraph in span, stands on its own, but the separate reflections combine to tell the larger story of Chers bumpy rise from poor sassy kid and naive starlet to independent singer and award-winning actress. Much to her credit, Cher has bypassed the common pitfall of the confessional genre: that of over-analyzing minor events and attributing to them major, long-term outcomes. Instead, the memories are stated sparsely; she doesnt spend too much time explaining them or justifying them emotionally. The result: a lighter, more enjoyable read. Though her bits and pieces dont always hang together solidly, and dont always follow in exact chronological order, the overall effect is nevertheless like listening in on Chers candid musings about significant events in her life. Oddly enough, her gimmicky format (most vignettes end too conveniently with an aphorism) actually works. Co-author Coplon has also been co-author to Sarah, Duchess of York. Despite cute, contrived styling, the reminiscences unfold in an honest and personal (though sometimes performed) fashion. As an added bonus, one can open the book at almost any page and start right inthe perfect arrangement for hard-pressed readers.

Her writing is so extensive and the range of issues she covers so enormous that those interested in finding her discussions of a given topic may have to search through many sources to locate the relevant passage. <b>The Ayn Rand Lexicon</b> brings together all the key ideas of her philosophy of Objectivism. Begun under Rand's supervision, this unique volume is an invaluable guide to her philosophy or reason, self-interest and laissez-faire capitalism--the philosophy so brilliantly dramatized in her novels The Fountainhead, We the Living, and Anthem.</p><p>Born February 2, 1905, <b>Ayn Rand</b> published her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, in 1936. <i>Anthem</i> followed in 1938. It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>.

Insisting on the centrality of women as historical actors and gender as a category of analysis, this work shows how the fateful political choices made by the low-country yeomanry were rooted in the politics of the household, particularly in the customary relations of power male heads of independent households assumed over their dependents, whether slaves or free women and children. Such masterly prerogatives, practiced in the domestic sphere and redeemed in the public, explain the yeomanry's deep commitment to slavery and, ultimately, their ardent embrace of secession.<br><br>By placing the yeomanry in the center of the drama, McCurry offers a significant reinterpretation of this volatile society on the road to Civil War. Through careful and creative use of a wide variety of archival sources, she brings vividly to life the small worlds of yeoman households, and the larger world of the South Carolina Low Country, the plantation South, and nineteenth-century America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephanie McCurry</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the University of California, San Diego.<br><br>"<em>Masters of Small Worlds</em>...is of interest not only for the local matter of South Carolina, but as one test of whether 'race, class, and gender' can...make a history and not just a battlecry...McCurry offers an abundance of insight, information and anecdote.

This beautifully crafted collection of short, seasonal essays combines in-depth information with evocative descriptions of nature&#x2019;s marvels and mysteries. Williams explains the weather conditions that bring out the brightest reds in autumn leaves, how hungry wolf spiders catch their prey, and why American goldfinches wait until late July or August to build their nests. In the tradition of Thoreau, Carson, and Leopold, Ted Williams&#x2019;s writing stands as a testament to the delicate balance of nature&#x2019;s resilience and fragility, and inspires readers to experience the natural world for themselves and to become advocates for protecting and preserving the amazing diversity and activity found there.</p><p>Ted Williams writes full-time on fish and wildlife issues for various national publications, including the monthly &#x201c;Recovery&#x201d; column for The Nature Conservancy&#x2019;s <i>Cool Green Science</i>.

Oliver Onions is unique in the realms of ghost story writers in that his tales are so far ranging in their background and substance that they are not easily categorised. His stories are powerfully charged explorations of psychical violence, their effects heightened by detailed character studies graced with a powerful poetic elegance. In simple terms Oliver Onions goes for the cerebral rather than the jugular. However, make no mistake, his ghost stories achieve the desired effect. They draw you in, enmeshing you in their unnerving and disturbing narratives. This collection contains such masterpieces as The Rosewood Door, The Ascending Dream, The Painted Face and The Beckoning Fair One, a story which both Algernon Blackwood and H. P.

What most people are not aware of is that he was primarily a poet, publishing nineteen books of poems during his lifetime, as well as a visual artist, novelist, playwright, and journalist. Half a dozen of these books have been excerpted and published in English over the years, but even if one were to read all of those, the wide range of poetic styles and subjects that occupied Pasolini during his lifetime would still elude the English-language reader.<br> <br> For the first time, Anglophones will now be able to discover the many facets of this singular poet. Avoiding the tactics of the slim, idiosyncratic, and aesthetically or politically motivated volumes currently available in English, Stephen Sartarelli has chosen poems from every period of Pasolini&#x2019;s poetic oeuvre. In doing so, he gives English-language readers a more complete picture of the poet, whose verse ranged from short lyrics to longer poems and extended sequences, and whose themes ran not only to the moral, spiritual, and social spheres but also to the aesthetic and sexual, for which he is most known in the United States today. This volume shows how central poetry was to Pasolini, no matter what else he was doing in his creative life, and how poetry informed all of his work from the visual arts to his political essays to his films. Pier Paolo Pasolini was &#x201c;a poet of the cinema,&#x201d; as James Ivory says in the book&#x2019;s foreword, who &#x201c;left a trove of words on paper that can live on as the fast-deteriorating images he created on celluloid cannot.&#x201d;<br> <br> This generous selection of poems will be welcomed by poetry lovers and film buffs alike and will be an event in American letters.</p></p><p><b>Pier Paolo Pasolini</b> (1922&#x2013;75) was an Italian film director, writer, and intellectual."An accused blasphemer deeply devoted to Franciscan Catholicism, a Gramscian communist permanently expelled from the party, an avowed homosexual dedicated to the consensual sexual freedom of everyone, a champion of the local on a global scale, a neorealist of the imagination, and a radically innovative poet alienated from the existing practices of the avant-garde: Pasolini is not so much a figure of contradictions as he is a force against the incoherence hiding in every hypocrisy." (Susan Stewart <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br>"This substantial bilingual edition of 76 poems, most drawn from seven major collections published in Italian between 1954 and 1971 and including some that appeared posthumously in 2003, is a welcome step toward redressing the damaging imbalance in the image of Pasolini conventionally offered to readers of English. Sartarelli's intelligent, stylish translations are accompanied by copious and helpful notes, a bibliography and filmography, and a spirited and very useful introduction. Wide-ranging, authoritative, and handsomely produced, Sartarelli's volume establishes itself immediately as by far the best selection of Pasolini's poetry available in English; its publication is a landmark in Pasolini studies.<i> . . . </i>Essential."<br> (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Pasolini is known as a filmmaker and political rebel, and for his tragic death, yet he was first and most importantly a poet. Sartarelli&#x2019;s brilliant translations have at last made his searingly beautiful poetry available to English-language readers.&#x201d; (John Ashbery)<br><br>&#x201c;Sartarelli&#x2019;s impeccable and inspired translations will be of incommensurable value to all students of Pasolini&#x2019;s oeuvre. This new English edition of Pasolini&#x2019;s poems is the most comprehensive and the most accurate version available in the Anglo-American world. Although Pasolini saw himself primarily as a poet, outside Italy his vast poetic production has not received the critical attention it certainly deserves. Sartarelli&#x2019;s generous selection and his sincere dedication will enhance our understanding of one of the major European artists of the twentieth century.&#x201d; (Armando Maggi, University of Chicago)<br><br>&#x201c;The remarkable range of Pasolini&#x2019;s poetic achievements, which in myriad ways underpin his renowned work in cinema and fiction, is brilliantly represented in Sartarelli&#x2019;s impressive bilingual edition. His translations convincingly convey Pasolini&#x2019;s densely woven, allusive poems, their musicality, passion, and lyricism. The touch of Sartarelli&#x2019;s confident, sensitive hand, of a poet who is also a scholar, has brought a most welcome new edition of one of the most important literary and cultural figures of the twentieth century.&#x201d; (Patrick Barron, University of Massachusetts Boston)</p><h2>John Maynard Keynes</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Today, Mr. Minsky's view [of economics] is more relevant than ever.&#x201d;- <i>The New York Times</i></b></p><b> </b><p><b>&#x201c;Indeed, the Minsky moment has become a fashionable catch phrase on Wall Street.&#x201d;-<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b></p> <p><i>John Maynard Keynes</i> offers a timely reconsideration of the work of the revered economics icon. Hyman Minsky argues that what most economists consider Keynesian economics is at odds with the major points of Keynes's <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</i>. Keynes and Minsky refuse to ignore pervasive uncertainty. Once uncertainty is given center stage, recurring episodes of financial system crises are all but inescapable. As Robert Barbera notes in a new preface, &#x201c;Benign economic circumstances...invite increasingly aggressive financial market wagers. Innovation in finance is a signature development in a capitalist economy.

Yet his most important legacy stands not upon his business acumen but on the pioneering changes he introduced to the practice of philanthropy.

The book shines light on his belief in the importance of giving in the present to make an impact on the future, and on his encouragement of beneficiaries to become partners in community institutions and projects.

Peter Doig is such an artist. While stories of painting&#x2019;s demise in the early 1990s deemed painters and their work quaintly anachronistic, Doig-looking ahead as much as back for inspiration-forged a new painterly language: an ironic mix of Romanticism and post-impressionism to create haunting and sometimes dreamlike landscape vistas.<br>In this lavish new volume devoted to his entire career-which includes paintings, drawings, and reference material, such as found photographs-art historians Richard Shiff and Catherine Lampert mine the artist&#x2019;s rich and varied work. Doig&#x2019;s landscapes have been inspired by the many places the artist has lived-England, Canada, Trinidad. So, too, does memory, or the idea of memory, inform much of his production. <br>This volume is designed in close collaboration with the artist, with Doig specially creating the cover and various elements of the interior. Every facet of the painter&#x2019;s singular vision is explored, from his earliest paintings of the early 1990s to the most recent series of works. <br>Published in association with Michael Werner Gallery&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Peter Doig</b> has been the subject of scores of exhibitions throughout his career, including a major traveling survey in 2008 at Tate Britain, Musee d&#x2019;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt. <b>Richard Shiff</b> is a renowned art historian and critic. <b>Catherine Lampert</b> is an independent curator and writer based in England.&#34;Landscape painting, so often pronounced dead, comes back to ghostly life in the haunting and haunted scenes of Peter Doig.&#34;-The Independent &#34;As part of Phaidon&#39;s Contemporary Artists series, Peter Doig provides a comprehensive look at the artist&#39;s oeuvre.&#34;-Men&#39;s Vogue On the Contemporary Artists Series &#34;The boldest, best executed, and most far-reaching publishing project devoted to contemporary art.
